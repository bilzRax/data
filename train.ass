From the earliest stages of fetal development, at birth, and through infancy, childhood, adolescence and on into adulthood, proper food and good nutrition are essential for survival, physical growth, mental development, performance, productivity, health and well-being.
Hill-Burton facilities are hospitals and nursing homes that have received money from the federal government and now must provide a certain amount of free or reduced-cost health services every year to those who cannot pay.
However, in contrast to fluid replacement, nutritional management of  requires good feeding practices both during the illness and between episodes of , when the child is not sick.
If a woman is malnourished during pregnancy, or if her child is malnourished during the first two years of life, the child's physical and mental growth and development may be slowed.
If the decision is about the need for a feeding programme, then our ignorance about the causes and physiological significance of stunting is embarrassing.
Improved feeding practices to prevent or treat malnutrition could save 800,000 lives per year.
Improved health outcomes in young children have long-lasting health effects throughout the life-span, including increased performance and productivity, and reduced risk of certain non-communicable diseases.
In children who are undernourished as a result of inadequate feeding, previous l episodes, or both, acute l episodes are more severe.
In countries where kwashiorkor is the major form of protein-energy malnutrition, the measurement of plasma albumin is important, as is blood haemoglobin where there is anaemia.
In general, the impact of  on nutritional status is proportional to the number of days a child spends with  each year.
In general, these effects are proportional to the degree of undernutrition, being greatest when undernutrition is severe.
In Guatemala, by contrast, the corresponding figure was only about 25 per cent.
In hospitals where good management of dehydration is practised, virtually all mortality from  is in undernourished children.
In most populations the prevalence of wasting decreases after the first two years, while that of stunting increases.
In the Gambia, for example, McGregor has shown that prior to 1973, 50 per cent of rural children had died before the age of five years.
In the interpretation of mortality data it is obviously important to take into account the cause of death.
In the running of public health programmes there is always a danger of an overemphasis on and evaluation.
In turn, undernutrition contributes to the problem of .
Internationally there is evidence of quite dramatic decreases in infant and pre-school mortality rates in recent years.
Interpretation can be complicated by large swings in seasonal incidence, as observed in the Gambia, Nigeria, and Nepal.
It is also a timely period to shape and consolidate healthy eating and lifestyle behaviours, thereby preventing or postponing the onset of nutrition-related chronic diseases in adulthood.
It is only fair to conclude that, although a reduction in morbidity, particularly from l disease, could be a very relevant indicator of the success of a maternal-child intervention.
Malnourished children are, in turn, more vulnerable to disease and the vicious circle is established.
Malnutrition contributes to more than half of all childhood deaths, although it is rarely listed as the direct cause.
Measures of population dynamics are always more revealing than single assessments of mortality.
More information is needed about the significance of growth deficits.
More precise information can be obtained by measurements of growth velocity.
More than half of all child deaths are associated with malnutrition, which weakens the body's resistance to illness.
Moreover, if  occurs frequently, there may be too little time to "catch up" on growth between episodes, the result being a flattening of the normal growth curve.
Mortality is a very crude and extreme indicator of functional impairment.
Mortality rate, particularly infant mortality rate, is one of the classical public-health indices, and the one-to-four-year age-group mortality rate has frequently been used in comparative international surveys as an index of the prevalence of undernutrition in different countries.
Mothers can be asked questions such as, "How many children have you had, how many are still alive, and at what ages did they die?"
Much has been written about the assessment of nutritional status in infants and young children by anthropometry.
National Organization for Rare Disorders patient assistance program offers free medication to people who otherwise cannot afford their medications.
Nutrition is a fundamental pillar of human life, health and development across the entire life span.
On the other hand, Mata in more recent studies in Costa Rica, has shown a very clear relationship between infant mortality rate and deaths from diarrhea.
One also needs detailed information about the age at death. In the context of this report it is especially relevant to examine the distribution of deaths during the first year of life.
Patients must meet financial and other program specific criteria to be eligible for assistance.
Persistent  is also more frequent and dysentery is more severe.
Poor diet, frequent illness, and inadequate or inattentive care of young children can lead to malnutrition.
Poor feeding practices and infection, or a combination of the two, are both major factors of malnutrition. Infection – particularly frequent or persistent , pneumonia, measles and malaria – undermines nutritional status.
Poor feeding practices, such as inadequate breastfeeding, offering the wrong foods, giving insufficient quantities, and not ensuring that the child gets enough food, contribute to malnutrition.
Research is desperately needed in which anthropometric change is quantitatively related, both to the health and well-being of the mother, as well as to the success of the pregnancy and the subsequent growth and development of the baby.
Since in some countries up to 50 per cent of pre-school children may be classified as stunted by the usual criteria (height-for-age less than 90 per cent of reference), it becomes extremely important to know more about the cause and significance of stunting.
Some states provide prescription drug assistance to women who are not covered by Medicaid.
Some workers look upon stunting as a successful adaptation to a shortage of food, although not successful enough for the child to overcome completely the changes in his environment.
States and eligible U.S. projects serve eligible patients up to and including age 18 years, providing routine immunizations with little to no out-of-pocket costs.
The final event may be a particularly severe or prolonged episode of  or, when severe undernutrition is present, another serious infection such as pneumonia.
The most meaningful measurements are weight-for-height and thigh circumference.
The number of variables and the resources required, the approach is more suitable as a research tool than for the routine assessment of a public health programme.
The PAHO survey in Latin America and the Caribbean showed than in most of the areas studied, about twice as many deaths occurred between one and six months as between six and twelve months.
The peak morbidity occurs between six and twelve months, i.e. after the peak of mortality, suggesting that weanling  is not the major cause of the high infant mortality.
The reason we have to concern ourselves with assessment, however, is that resources are becoming increasingly limited, and it is necessary to know what we have achieved and what we have failed to achieve.
The relation between nutritional state and malaria is complex; both adversely affect total immune competence.
The risk of dying from an episode of persistent  or dysentery is considerably increased when a child is already undernourished.
The usual cross-sectional approach is, however, relatively insensitive to change unless it is dramatic.
There are nutritional issues, which are adolescent-specific, and which call for specific strategies and approaches.
There is an additional reason for this in anthropometric assessment.
There is no use in having an indicator unless it is useful for making decisions.
They lead to improved nutrition and physical growth, reduced susceptibility to common childhood infections and better resistance to cope with them.
This cannot be made up when the child is older – it will affect the child for the rest of his or her life.
This is because nutrient requirements are increased during , as during other infectious diseases, whereas nutrient intake and absorption are usually decreased.
This naturally requires longitudinal measures, but the advantage is that quite small samples can give meaningful results.
Thus,  and undernutrition combine to form a vicious circle which, if it is not broken, can eventually result in death.
To be realistic, however, it will be some time before there are completely reliable statistics for most developing countries, but even quite simple retrospective studies on relatively small samples can be valuable.
To get an accurate estimate of the incidence and severity of diseases that may be related to nutritional state is obviously difficult; l disease is the condition that has received most attention in so far as the young child is concerned.
To safeguard the nutritional health of women during their reproductive age, it is important to consider pre-pregnant status as well as that during pregnancy and lactation.
Vaccines for Children Program helps families by providing free vaccines to doctors who serve eligible children and is administered at the national level by the CDC.
We also need to know not only the frequency of episodes of infection but also their duration, which is an important indicator of severity.
Whatever the reason, it does emphasize that mortality as an indicator of nutritional status can be a very blunt instrument without additional knowledge concerning specific causes.
When this is done, and undernutrition is either prevented or corrected, the risk of death from a future episode of  is greatly reduced.
You may apply for Hill-Burton assistance at any time before or after you receive care by simply asking for Hill-Burton assistance.
100% immunization coverage against measles is the programme goal.

Health workers will be trained to use these practices, and will convey the techniques to mothers.
If a woman is malnourished during pregnancy, or if her child is malnourished during the first two years of life, the child's physical and mental growth and development may be slowed.
If mothers could recognize and treat dehydration early on at home, the great majority of children would not need additional medical care.
If nutritional intake is inadequate, the consequences persist throughout life.
If this is not possible, maximum efforts should continue towards this end and, in the meantime, as complete a formulation as possibly should be used, recognizing its limitations.
Improved feeding practices to prevent or treat malnutrition could save 800,000 lives per year.
Improved health outcomes in young children have long-lasting health effects throughout the life-span, including increased performance and productivity, and reduced risk of certain non-communicable diseases.
In cases of dehydration, should be offered as soon as initial rehydration therapy has been completed.

Lack of clear policy focus on areas with greatest levels of malnutrition.
Malnourished children are less likely to perform well in school and more likely to grow into malnourished adults, at greater risk of disease and early death.
Malnourished children are, in turn, more vulnerable to disease and the vicious circle is established.
Malnutrition can result from suboptimal breastfeeding practices, poor quality complementary foods, detrimental feeding practices, and contamination of complementary food and feeding utensils.
Malnutrition contributes to more than half of all childhood deaths, although it is rarely listed as the direct cause.
Malnutrition in children is not affected by food intake alone.
Malnutrition in early childhood has serious, long-term consequences because it impedes motor, sensory, cognitive, social and emotional development.
Malnutrition is also influenced by access to health services, quality of care for the child and pregnant mother as well as good hygiene practices.
Malnutrition is more common in India than in Sub-Saharan Africa.

The prevalence of malnutrition varies across states, with Madhya Pradesh recording the highest rate (55 per cent) and Kerala among the lowest (27 per cent).
The routine use of any special infant formula (lactose-free products) for diarrhoea cases should be strongly discouraged as they are only rarely necessary and are costly.
The second half of an infant's first year is an especially vulnerable time because infants are learning to eat and must be fed soft foods frequently and patiently.

A child that functions according to the equivalent modus only, doesn’t experience a difference between reality and fantasy.
A child’s development of self-regulating mechanisms and ability to mentalise (which, when taken together are called Interpersonal Interpretative Function, IIF) are dependent on their “early attachment relation”.
A modified version has been introduced for birth parents, which is currently being tested in a small group.
According to the developers the goal of the project is to develop a theory- and evidence-based intervention protocol that can be used in a partnership between professionals trained in scientifically based attachment procedures.
Although attachment theory has become a major scientific theory of socioemotional development with one of the broadest, deepest research lines in modern psychology.
Although such interventions share some approaches, treatment methods can be quite different from each other.
An important concept is “the ability to mentalise”.
An overwhelming flow of anxiety for instance can cause the child to fall back in to an equivalent modus of operating.
As this ‘mentalization process’ develops the child functions in the pretend modus and is capable of using symbolic representations.
Attachment theory has, until recently, been less clinically applied than theories with far less empirical support.
Attachment theory may be partly due to lack of attention paid to clinical application by Bowl by himself and partly due to broader meanings of the word 'attachment' used amongst practitioners.
Based on findings that foster children's attachments are disproportionately likely to be disorganized and foster mothers with an unresolved or dismissing state of mind were likely to have children with disorganized attachments.
Caregiver and child behaviors are assessed before and after intervention, as is the child regulation of neuroendocrine function.
Caregivers learn, understand and then practice observational and inferential skills regarding their children's attachment behaviors and their own caregiving responses.
Children experiencing frightening conditions have a limited range of responses and often 'dissociate' as a way of coping.
Circle of Security is being field tested within the 'Head Start'/'Early Head Start' programme in the USA.
During the therapy sessions the parent expresses his or her thoughts and feelings which are based on a combination of factors including.
Five sessions per week are a combination of talk and play.
For these reasons, readers should take special care to consider definitions of terms in this article.
Foster cares tend to respond 'in kind' to infants behavior.
Foster children often show an atypical production of the stress hormone cortisol.
Half the infants are assigned to the Developmental Education for Families programme as a comparison intervention.
Here it is important that the child goes through their own feelings and recognize them forming them into mental representations.
Here the main goal is to direct and focus the attention of the child to the inner world (feelings, thoughts, wishes and impulses).
If children are at a very young age an adapted psychoanalytic technique maybe necessary.
If foster infants behave in an avoidant or resistant manner, foster cares may act as if the infant does not need them.
If the normal course of secure attachment between parent and infant is disrupted, parent-infant psychotherapy is one technique that can be used to restore this bond.
In affect regulation the often diffuse affects of the child within the therapeutic relation are explored.
In some cases parent-infant psychotherapy is a possibility.
Infants in foster care are often dysregulated at physiological, behavioral and emotional levels.
Infants in foster care often experience threatening conditions.
Infants in foster care often fail to elicit nurturance.
Intervention programme aims to provide specialized help for foster carers in recognition of the fact that a young child placed in foster care has to deal with the loss of attachment figures at a time when maintaining contact with attachment figures is vital.
Intervention programme is essentially a training programme for surrogate caregivers.
Intervention programme targets key issues: providing nurturance for infants when the carers are not comfortable providing nurturance, overriding tendencies to respond in kind to infant behaviors and providing a predictable interpersonal environment.
Interventions are based on improving thinking about mental conditions and mental processes.
It is not established whether this is significant for increased risk for later disorders, but very low or very high levels are associated with types of psychopathology in adults.
It is reported that preliminary results of data analysis of 75 dyads suggest a significant shift from disordered to ordered patterns, and increases in classifications of secure attachment.
It is stated that it is explicitly based on contemporary attachment and congruent developmental theories.
MBKT addresses problems with an infant’s ability to distinguish reality and fantasy.
MBKT can be qualified as an intensive form of therapy with two to five sessions per week.
MBKT helps lower the risk for psychopathological developments of the child in the future.
MBKT technique helps the parent to resolve issues with his or her own infancy-experiences in order to restore secure attachment with the infant.
Mental health interventions for children vary with respect to the problem being addressed and to the age and other individual characteristics of the child.
Mentaliseren Bevorderende Kinder Therapie is translated as “therapy for children enhancing their ability to mentalise”.
Mentalization is a conscious as well as an unconscious process which enables people to see that actions and thoughts of themselves and others are motivated by internal thoughts, intentions and attitudes.
Mentalizing is accomplished when two developmental concepts can be integrated.
One of the functions of parents is to protect children from real or perceived dangers.
Other components which are crucial in the development of the child and also mainly dependent on the quality of the attachment to the parent are “attention regulation” and “affect regulation”.
Parent-Infant Psychotherapy addresses problems with normal relationships between parent and child.
Possible evidence for this may be the disproportionate number of disorganized attachment patterns in foster children.
Prime examples are threats contingent upon behavior to have the child removed or taken away.
Providing nurturance when it does not come naturally.
Sessions are videotaped for feedback and for fidelity.
Specifically, the equivalent modus and the pretend modus.
Terms describing child treatments may vary from one part of the world to another, with particular differences in the use of the terms "psychotherapy" and "psychoanalysis".
The ability to mentalise is the capability of seeing one’s self or other people’s behaviour in terms of assumed mental conditions.
The aim is to reduce threatening behavior among foster parents by helping them understand the impact on the child.
The aim of the protocol is to present these ideas to the parents in a ‘userfriendly’, common-sense fashion that they can understand both cognitively and emotionally.
The child isn’t aware of the reality level when he’s pretending.
The childs attachment pattern is classified using either Ainsworth or the PAC (Preschool Attachment Classification System).
The developers themselves point out that they do not test for caregiver commitment although they state this may or may not be a critical omission as they consider caregiver commitment to be a crucial variable in terms of child outcomes.
The goal here is to help foster parents follow the child lead and become more responsive social partners.
The goal is to help foster parents provide nurturing care even if they are non-autonomous with regard to their own attachment status.
The goal is to train foster carers to act in a nurturing manner even in the absence of cues from the infant.
The interpretation of Dozier et al is that foster children have difficulty organizing their attachment systems unless they have nurturing foster cares.
The intervention consists of 10 sessions administered in care givers homes by professional social workers.
The intervention is currently being assessed in a randomized clinical trial involving 200 foster families, supported by the National Institute of Mental Health.
The Nederlands Psychoanalytisch Instituut NPI (Dutch Psychoanalytic Institute) has been working with a form of therapy for children called “Mentaliseren Bevorderende Kinder Therapie” (MBKT) since 2003.
The parent’s expectations and hopes for the child’s future.
The program is designed to address the developmental and health needs of children under the age of 5 who have been maltreated and placed in foster care.
The program is funded by the state government of Louisiana and private funds.
The programme, which takes place weekly over 20 weeks, consists of group sessions, video feedback vignettes and psycho-educational and therapeutic discussions.
The protocol has so far been aimed at and tested on preschoolers up to the age of 4 years.
The starting point in “attention regulation” is that the child is still functioning from the “equivalent modus” which means there are insufficient affect representations.
The therapist will play and talk with the child in order to make contact with the inner world of the child and thus shape all the bits and pieces that needs to be integrated.
The therapist’s role is as an observer and an interpreter of the interaction between the infant and the parent.
The therapy is then 'individualized' according to each dyads attachment/caregiver pattern.
Therapist might share some of his thoughts about the behaviour of the child with the parent and by doing so offering the parent an alternative way of experiencing the child.
There are several different techniques to approach the psychoanalytic treatment of children.
There is an initial assessment which utilises the 'Strange Situation' procedure, (Ainsworth 1978), observations, a videotaped interview using the Parent Development Interview (Aber et al 1989) and the Adult Attachment Interview (George et al 1984) and caregiver questionnaires regarding the child.
This an intervention programme aimed at infants who have experienced early adverse care and disruptions in care.
This article covers all types of therapies aimed at children from behavioural, psychodynamic or other fields.
This has often broken down for foster children, and worse, the caregiver may have served as a threat themselves.
This incapability to integrate those feelings may influence the modus in which the child comes to operate.
This is a foster care intervention devised by J.A.Larrieu and C.H Zeanah in 1998.
This is a parent education and psychotherapy intervention developed by Marvin et al (2002) designed to shift problematic or 'at risk' patterns of attachment – caregiving interactions to a more appropriate developmental pathway.
This is done by a graphic representation of the child’s needs and attachment system in circle form, summarizing the child’s needs and the safe haven provided by the caregiver.
This latter point aims to address the miscuing defensive strategies of the caregiver.
This technique requires a three-way relationship between the parent, child and therapist.
This therapy is partly based on the theory of Fonagy [3] (2002) in which mentalization is the central theme.
To increase the caregivers sensitivity and appropriate responsiveness to the child’s signals relevant to its moving away from to explore, and its moving back for comfort and soothing.
To increase their ability to reflect on their own and the child’s behavior, thoughts and feelings regarding their attachment – caregiving interactions.
To reflect on experiences in their own histories that affects their current caregiving patterns.
Traumata can cause the child to refrain from very painful feelings connected to the events and or persons connected to the trauma.
Two techniques will be discussed: Parent-Infant Psychotherapy and Mentaliseren Bevorderende Kinder Therapie (MBKT).
When both modus are integrated the child is aware that he’s pretending and then we speak of mentalization.
When the regulation of either is not sufficient a therapy may help to influence the flow of both.
With a child that only functions in the pretend modus there’s a difference between reality and fantasy however they exist separately from each other.
With “the ability to mentalise” concept different types of mental processes play a role.
'"Manipulation of sensitive responsiveness", van den Boom (1994) This intervention focused on low socio-economic group mothers with irritable infants, assessed on a behavioural scale.
'"Modified Interaction Guidance" Benoit et al (2001)' This intervention aimed to reduce inappropriate caregiver behaviours as measured on the AMBIANCE (atypical maternal behaviour instrument for assessment and classification).
A population mean volume of 650 ml would be considered low. As with bodyweight, it is apparent that considerable metabolic adaptation protects milk supply against the worst effects of dietary deficiency.
A reduced level of activity in children consuming inadequate but not disastrously low amounts of dietary energy has also been reported among rural children living in Uganda.
A significant decrease in inappropriate maternal behaviours and disrupted communication was found in the MIG group.
Acceleration of growth was confirmed and clinical examination of the children and reports from teachers suggested that the milk-fed children had improved in general condition and became much more alert and more boisterous and difficult to control than others.
Activity is an even more relevant functional parameter for pregnant and lactating women, as they represent an important component of the labouring work-force, particularly in rural areas of the developing world.
All maternal components improved. Further, a 'strange situation' assessment carried out at 12 months showed only 38% classified as insecure compared to 78% in the control group.
All the types of indicators discussed can be useful as long as their limitations are appreciated.
Also the infant has the experience of negotiating their relationship with their mother.
An example of the latter use is a large-scale integrated rural development programme currently being funded by the British government in Nepal.
An important measurement is the baby's milk intake, although there is a wide normal range, and at an individual level only values below 500 ml/24 hr between one and five months of age can definitely be considered inadequate.
As discussed in section 1.17, studies in Sri Lanka have demonstrated that iron supplementation enables work output to be increased.
As of 2005, 250 children had participated in the programme.
Assessment measures used were the Ainsworth sensitivity rating, Ainsworth et al (1974).
Assessment of maternal nutritional status during lactation is more difficult.
Attachment security involved 29 studies and 1,503 participants.
Birth-weights in poor economic circumstances in the developing world are much lower than in Europe and North America
Changes in parental sensitivity are causally related to attachment security.
Children entering psychotherapy have most often been exposed to family violence or other traumatic experiences.
Cohen et al (1999)' This intervention involved mothers and infants referred for a community health service.
Developmental delays in the children are common and there is a considerable range of regulatory, socioemotional and developmental problems.
Early intervention on parental sensitivity and infant attachment security is effective.
Especially 'miscues' as the signals of such children are often confusing as a consequence of their often frightening, inconsistent and confusing past relationships.
For example, protein deficiency may compound the fall in albumin concentration that normally accompanies pregnancy because of haemodilution.
For half the session the mother gets down on the floor with the infant, observes it and interacts only on the infant initiative.
For lactating women it is likely that assessments of overall health and well-being plus her capacity for an active life are likely to be the most revealing.
For the second half the mother discusses her observations and experiences.
Foster care are also formally assessed using a structured clinical interview which includes in particular the meaning of the child to the foster parent..
Foster cares are regularly contacted and visited to assess their needs and progress.
Foster cares are taught to recognize what such children actually need rather than what they may appear to signal that they need.
Foster parents may also present barriers to forming healthy attachment relationships. Based on Bowlby, the care giving system is seen as a bio behavioral system in adults that is complementary to the child attachment system.
Further, despite harsh and inconsistent treatment many of the children remain attached to their parents, complicating the development of new attachment relationships.
In Guatemala, by contrast, the corresponding figure was only about 25 per cent.
In Nepal there are inputs from agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, irrigation, and education as well a health.
In research programmes, placental weight is also an important measurement.
In the Gambia the unanimous first reason given by pregnant and lactating mothers for the popularity of the biscuit supplement was that it gave them more "power" for work.
In the interpretation of mortality data it is obviously important to take into account the cause of death.
Individualised interventions for each child are devised based on age, clinical presentation and information on the child/foster care match.
Infants in the watch, wait and wonder group were significantly more likely to shift to a secure or organised attachment classification than infants in the psychodynamic psychotherapy group.
Intervention programmes are always and universally effective.
Intervention was based on Ainsworth's sensitive responsiveness components, namely perceiving a signal, interpreting it correctly, selecting an appropriate response and implementing the response effectively.
Interventions include supporting foster parents to learn to help the child in regulating emotions, to learn to respond effectively to the child distress and to understand the child signals.
Investigations into work capacity and energy output need to be designed with imagination and flexibility.
It has been pointed out however that specific care giver response to attachment (the precursors to secure attachments) were not measured.
It is based on the notion of the infant as initiator in infant-parent psychotherapy.
It is not unreasonable to suggest that the latter style of working provides a greater sense of well-being and general happiness.
It is possible for a woman to complete the same task with a minimum of extraneous effort or with more joie de vivre.
It is quite apparent that the use of functional tests is a subject that merits a much greater research input.
It was found that these infants scored significantly higher than the control infants on sociability, self soothing and reduced crying.
It will be necessary to establish an appropriate methodology in which data will be collected on a continuing basis.
Not all foster cares have this strong biological disposition as many fear becoming too 'attached' and suffering loss, many are effectively doing it to earn money and some perceive such children as 'damaged goods' and may remain emotionally distant and under involved.
Of equal importance, whose results will be analysed and made available quickly so that necessary changes in the overall programme can be made when necessary.
Outcome data published in 2001 revealed a 68% reduction in maltreatment recidivism for the same child returning to its parent(s) and a 75% reduction in recidivism for a subsequent child of the same mother.
Plasma amino-acid patterns can also be informative, but this is a subject for research.
Presenting problems included feeding, sleeping, behavioural regulation, maternal depression and feelings of failure in bonding or attachment.
Psychiatric and substance abuse histories and other criminal activities are common.
Quite apart from their intrinsic physiological interest, it would enable the merits of nutritional intervention programmes to be translated into terms relevant to national development planning.
Sensitivity findings were based on 81 studies involving 7,636 families.
Serious relationship disturbances are considered likely to be important contributors to difficulties in establishing new attachment relationships.
Since there is, as yet, no evidence that they were doing more actual work, it can only be concluded that this statement means the mothers were better able to work well within their capacity rather than at the extreme limit.
Soon after coming into care the children are intensively assessed, in foster care, and then receive multi modal treatments.
Studies at INCAP in Guatemala have likewise demonstrated that energy intake of pre-school children can be reduced from 90 to 80 kcal/kg without affecting nitrogen balance or growth.
Such children often exhibit provocative and oppositional behaviors which may normally trigger feelings of rejection in caregivers.
Such inappropriate behaviours are thought to contribute to disorganized attachment.
Such measurements could not be recommended for public health programmes at the present time.
The aim of the foster care intervention is to support the building of an attachment relationship between the children and foster cares, even though about half of the children eventually return to their parents after about 12 to 18 months.
The aim was to develop a programme for designing foster care as an intervention.
The assessment 'team' remains involved in delivering the intervention.
The biochemical measurements listed in the previous paragraph can be of even greater importance during pregnancy.
The child may perceive relationships as inconsistent and undependable.
The concept of using nutritional status indicators for this purpose has been accepted enthusiastically.
The conclusion was that "Interventions with an exclusively behavioural focus on maternal sensitivity appear to be most effective not only in enhancing maternal sensitivity but also in promoting children's attachment security."
The designers note Mary Doziers program to foster the development of relationships between children and foster cares (ABC) and her work showing the connection between foster children's symptomology and foster cares attachment status.
The difference in height growth between supplemented and unsupplemented children in this trial was 6 mm/year, but the difference in activity was likely to have been of much greater importance.
The disturbed nature of the child relationship with its parent(s) before their removal by the state.
The idea is that it increases the mother sensitivity and responsiveness by fostering an observational reflective stance, whilst also being physically accessible.
The proportion of children born with a weight below 2.5 kg is a particularly relevant statistic because neonatal and infant mortality rise sharply below this point.
The randomly assigned control group undertook psychodynamic psychotherapy.
The randomly assigned group received 3 treatment sessions, between the ages of 6 and 9 months, based on maternal responsiveness to negative and positive infant cues.
The selection criteria were very broad, intending to include as many intervention studies as possible.
There is a conscious effort to build on recent, although limited, research into the incidence and causes of Reactive attachment disorder and risk factors for RAD and other psychopathologies.
There is one final type of measurement of great potential value: measurement of functional capacity, an obvious example being the level of physical activity.
They can be used for the obvious direct purpose of assessing the effect of interventions on nutrition and health, but also as indirect indicators of social development.
They might be taken more seriously by politicians and government officials than would more medical and biochemical measurements whose significance is less obvious.
This cannot be solely attributable to dietary deficiency since infections like malaria can profoundly affect birth-weigh.
This was an attempt to collect and synthesise the data to try to come to "evidence based" conclusions on the best intervention practices for attachment in infants.
Thomson(15), describing trials organized in the United Kingdom by Boyd Orr and others in the 1920s to test the effect of giving milk to school-children.
Those running the programme maintain regular phone and visit contact and there are support groups for foster parents.
Three studies were singled out by Prior and Glaser to illustrate intervention processes which have shown good results.
To maintain this enthusiasm, however, and to provide the governments of both nations with meaningful information.
Treating traumatized children may be unusually challenging for the therapist because of vicarious traumatization.
Type and timing of Intervention programme makes a difference.
Weight is normally lost during lactation at a rate of 570 g/month (14), but, as described in section 3.2, considerable metabolic adaptations occur and excessive weight loss is not observed unless food intake is exceptionally low.
Withdrawn children may be overlooked and seemingly independent, indiscriminate children may be considered to be managing much better than they are.
Work is based on findings that the qualitative features of foster parent narrative descriptions of the child and relationship with the child have been strongly associated with the foster parents.
31% of children under the age of 5 in the developing world are moderately (height-for-age is below minus 2 standard deviations) or severely stunted (below minus 3 standard deviations).
A direct policy focus on determinants of childhood cognitive ability has been urged.
A group of largely African American urban first-grade children and their caregivers were evaluated using self-report, interview, and standardized tests, including IQ tests.

A recent theory suggests that early childhood stress may affect the developing brain and cause negative effects.
A significantly positive and fairly substantial effects was found on increasing the probability of attending school and of passing the first grade, increasing the grade attained by age 13, increasing completed schooling attainment, and for adults aged 25-40 increasing IQ test scores.
A study from the Philippines argues that malnutrition in the second year of life may have a larger negative impact than malnutrition in the first year of life.

Additional vitamin-mineral supplementation may have an effect also in the developed world.
Adjusting for maternal cognitive ability as measured by IQ and education eliminated the association between lower IQ and tobacco smoking.
Although some observers have argued that the first six months of life are the most critical in the sense that malnutrition during that time period harms cognitive development more than malnutrition later in life
Although these prevention campaigns are highly successful, most were initiated only after substantial delays.
An appendix listed furher industrial chemicals considered to be neurotoxic.
Another study found a positive effect of breastfeeding also after controlling for parental IQ.

Fish oil supplement to pregnant and lactating mothers has been linked to increased cognitive ability in one study.
For example, acute undernutrition for a few months during the Dutch famine of 1944 caused a decrease in mean birthweight in certain areas.
For example, the Copenhagen consensus, states that lack of both iodine and iron has been implicated in impaired brain development, and this can affect enormous numbers of people.
Fortification of staple foods (cereals, flour, sugar, salt) to deliver micronutrients to children on a large scale is probably the most sustainable and affordable option, even though commitment from governments and the food industry is needed.
Giving a nutritional supplementation (1 kg milk based formula each week) to these already stunted children had no significant effect on later scores, but psychosocial stimulation (weekly play sessions with mother and child) had a positive effect.
Health and intelligence are two closely-related aspects of human well-being.
Healthcare during pregnancy and childbirth, access to which is often governed by policy, also influences cognitive development.
his was not later associated with a change in performance on IQ tests for 18-19 years old Dutch males draftees from these areas compared to control areas.
However, a majority of products sold there are cited by Hong Kong officials to contain mercury as its active ingredient, often a whopping 27,000 to 60,000 times the "acceptable" dose.
However, a recent study finds that maternal tobacco smoking has no direct causal effect on the child's IQ.

However, this is costly, distribution mechanisms are often ineffective, and compliance is low.
In developing countries, it is estimated that 40% of children aged four and under suffer from anaemia because of insufficient iron in their diets.
In order to prevent iron deficiency an option is giving specific supplementation, for example as tablets.
Instead, it was the mother's IQ that had a significant correlation with the IQ of her offspring, whether the offspring was breastfed or was not breastfed.
It is estimated that 2 billion people (one-third of the total global population) are affected by iodine deficiency, including 285 million 6- to 12-year-old children.
It may also happen due to deficiencies of different nutrients, such as micronutrients, protein or energy.
Malnutrition may occur during several different periods of growth, such as pregnancy, during breastfeeding, infancy, or childhood.
Many additional chemicals have been shown to be neurotoxic in laboratory models.
Maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy is associated with increased activity, decreased attention, and diminished intellectual abilities.
Micronutrient deficiencies (e.g. in iodine and iron) influence the development of intelligence and remain a problem in the developing world.
More speculatively, other nutrients may prove important in the future.
Most of this can explain by the very large increase for a subgroup of the children, presumably because these were not adequately nourished unlike the majority.
Neighborhood risk has been related to lower school grades for African-American adolescents in another study from 2006.
On the disease front, malaria affects 300–500 million persons each year, mostly children under age five in Africa.
One study from developing country, Guatemala, found that poor growth during infancy, rather than low birth weight, was negatively related to adolescent performance on cognitive and achievement tests.
Overall, studies investigating whether cognitive function in already iron-deficient children can be improved with iron supplements have produced mixed results, possible because deficiency in critical growth periods may cause irreversible damage.
Policies to manage lead differ between nations, particularly between the developed and developing world.
Policy recommendations to increase availability of micronutrient supplements have been made and justified in part by the potential to counteract intelligence-related developmental problems.
Preventable causes of low intelligence in children include infectious diseases such as meningitis, parasites, and cerebral malaria, prenatal drug and alcohol exposure, newborn asphyxia, low birth weight, head injuries, and endocrine disorders.
Recognition of these risks has led to evidence-based programmes of prevention, such as elimination of lead additives in petrol.
Several factors can lead to significant cognitive impairment, particularly if they occur during pregnancy and childhood when the brain is growing and the blood-brain barrier is less effective.
Several studies from developed nations have found that with the exception of extreme intrauterine growth retardation also affecting brain growth, and hypoxic injury, IUGR seems to have little or no measurable effect on mental performance and behavior in adolescence or adulthood.
Several studies with better design have shown substantial benefits.
Since mother's IQ was predictive of whether a child was breastfed, the study concluded that "breast feeding [itself] has little or no effect on intelligence in children."
Since SES correlates with IQ, this may have hidden an effect caused by the undernutrition.
Skin whitening products, which a majority sold in Asian nations contain mercury or hydroquinone, are also very harmful to the brain development of fetuses in pregnant women.
Skin whitening products; often contain toxic chemicals, such as mercury and hydroquinone, as the active ingredient.

The subjects were exposed to famine prenatally but not after birth. During the famine, births decreased more among those with lower SES, whereas after the famine, there was a compensatory increase in births among those with lower SES.
The use of skin whitening products is especially popular in Hong Kong.
The use of some skin whitening products, unusually popular amongst Asian women, has detrimental effects toward IQ.
These include laws requiring fortification of certain food products and laws establishing safe levels of pollutants (e.g. lead, mercury, and organochlorides).
They were less likely to have children with low verbal IQ, motor coordination and behavioral problems.
Those with the "G" version have no IQ advantage.
Two studies in Chile on 18 years old high-school graduates found that nutritional status during the first year of life affected IQ, scholastic achievement, and brain volume.

Researchers at the Duke University medical school in the southeastern state of North Carolina studied 1.16 million birth in Norway between 1967 and 1988 and followed the subjects through 2002.
Routines, meal-time happy conversations, dressing up boring meals are some ways that encourage better eating habits.
Serve soya bean chunks or bit-size boiled vegetables like carrots, broccoli along with a cheese dip or fondue.
She will then automatically be more particular about the food she eats - it all goes with the lifestyle.
Slightly more boys were born premature than girls (5.6 percent to 4.7 percent), which reflects the larger ratio of male births, said the study which appears in the March 26 edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
So don't keep pushing food down her throat, especially food that is fattening.
Some children do indeed grow out of their baby fat as they grow older, but many do not.
Some children may seem especially difficult for a particular parent to handle.
Some parents mistakenly believe that by cooking ghee, oil-rich and sugar-laden food for their families, they are somehow proving their love to them.
Studies in Canada and the United States have shown that communities in rural areas as well as minorities are less likely to have available prenatal care and also have higher rates of infant mortality and miscarriage.
Supplement energy foods with nutrient dense foods.
That risk was 2.5 to 2.3 times higher than babies born at term.
The aim of good prenatal care is to detect any potential problems early, to prevent them if possible (through recommendations on adequate nutrition, exercise, vitamin intake etc), and to direct the woman to appropriate specialists, hospitals, etc. if necessary.
The availability of routine prenatal care has played a part in reducing maternal death rates and miscarriages as well as birth defects, low birth weight, and other preventable infant problems in the developed world.
The less you stock at home, the less your child will have.
The skin of many vegetables is rich in vitamins and minerals, so offer fresh fruits to the child with their skins.
There are other parents that go overboard, and keep giving their children what they think are encouraging words of advice, by telling them that they should watch what they eat, control their diet, exercise more and so on, over and over and over.
These men and women had also a 76 and 67 percent probability of not reproducing at comparable rates to adults born at full term.
They think of it as baby fat, which the child will soon lose as he grows into an adult.
Try and disassociate serving food with proof of love or proof of your household skills.
Try and get her involved in a sport when she is still very young.
Try banana shakes, fruit custard and creamed soups for your child’s nutrition.
Ultrasounds are considered relatively safe and have been used for over 35 years for monitoring pregnancy.
Unpolished rice or par-boiled rice is better than polished rice.
Use less of sugar, salt and refined flour (maida or all-purpose flour) preparations.
Wherever possible, use jaggery instead of sugar, since it is very high in iron.
While availability of prenatal care has considerable personal health and social benefits, socioeconomic problems prevent its universal adoption in many developed as well as developing nations.
Whole milk, dairy products, nuts and unskinned potatoes are some high calorie foods with nutrients.
Without being vocal about your intentions, start stocking up on healthy snacks.
You are causing more damage to her self-esteem than you realize.
You should control your child's intake of sweets, biscuits, chocolates, cakes, colas, etc. because sugar is a major cause of tooth decay.
Your baby’s BMI (body mass index) will be calculated.
Your child's weight and height will be taken into account and compared to standard growth charts.
Your doctor will recommend a higher calorie intake.
Your pediatrician or physician will be the best person to answer that your child is underweight.
Your physician might ask you to boost his nutrient and calorie intake.
71 women's community based organisations are becoming involved in health/development activities.
A co-ordination of the four factors - menstrual period (rithu), the womb (kshetra), nutrient liquid (rasa ambu), and healthy semen (beeja shukra), and observance of a proper regimen are necessary for the conception and development of a healthy child.
Aachaaryaas have stressed two points while describing the factors responsible for a proper conception and the birth of a healthy child.
According to a recent report of the Indian Council of Medical Research the current maternal mortality rate is 4 - 7 per 1000 live births.
According to Aayurvedic Philosophy the human body is composed of five mahaabhoothas.
After the completion of eighth month the foetus is mature enough for delivery i.e. from the first day of the ninth month one should be prepared for delivery at any time.
Almost all these studies suffer from the limitation that the "evaluation" of the Local practices has been done invariably only from the point of view of modern medicine.
At present there are number of studies and surveys available which has gathered information on the local practices in the area of Mother and Child Health.
Attraction for each other and happiness of mind are essential for the birth of a healthy child and that is why our aachaaryaas have stressed on such points.
Better all round healthcare and awareness of health needs of pregnant women and children less than five years.
Both husband and wife wearing white apparel and garlands, with happiness of mind and an attraction for each other should enter into cohabitation.
Cases commonly referred are difficult delivery cases/complications; severe anaemia, other maternity and child cases needing referral, family planning operations.
Children adapt and grow in response to their environment regardless of their biological or genetic attributes.
Children differ tremendously yet are alike in many ways.
Cohabitation during the daytime is held to be harmful.
Combat ignorance, superstition, and low level of literacy especially among women, which compounds health problems, feeding prejudices and harmful practices.
Control of preventable diseases (e.g. diarrhoea, malaria), especially in women and and children.
Decrease in anaemia and iron deficiency in women and children through nutritional supplements including iron; majority of women receiving pregnancy care and safe delivery.
During the rithu kaala the woman should avoid sleeping in the daytime, anointing the body, running, hearing loud sounds, indulging in upavaasa or any heavy and strenuous work.
Elimination of malnutrition through better nutritional interventions for children and pregnant women.
Factors related to the previous birth are bakthi, good conduct, memory, cleanliness, charity, courage, feebleness, wealth, wavering mind and jealously.
Features development from the aatma are birth in a specific species, knowledge about oneself, manas, respiration, retention and ejaculation of respiration and flatus, appearence, voice, specific complexion, happiness, sorrow, longing and hatred.
Focused attention to reducing the incidence of anaemia.
For three days after the appearance of the menses the young wife should avoid cohabitation, should sleep on a grass mat (made of kusha grass), eat mild food like plain rice, from small earthen vessels.
Growth of community based institutions that will initiate and take responsibility for healthcare and other development needs of the community.
Hence for baby to be born with all the good qualities it is essential that all these factors viz., the mother, father, rasa (the product of digestion of the mother’s food) the aatma etc. Should be in good state.
Hence, to have a healthy child the contributing factors viz. shukra and aarthava, should be in their normal healthy state.
His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales visited Kutail Gamri village, one of the 35 villages adopted by Pfizer for the Mother and Child Primary HealthCare Community based program in rural Haryana.
However, it is equally possible that ISMs themselves can benefit by systematically observing various local practices - some of these cannot be readily comprehended in the light of the theory of ISMs.
Immunisations now cover over 98% of the children in these target villages.
Impoverished villagers are trained for healthcare and rural development activities as health workers, midwives, motivators and community organisers.
In 1986 the Lok Swaasthya Parampara Samvardhan Samithi (LSPSS) had decided to hold a convention on the theme of - "Mother and Child Health in Traditional Medicine".
In 1989 December a National Convention was organised on the theme of "Mother and Child Health in Traditional Systems of Medicine".
In November/December 2001, Pfizer India had supported a survey, which was conducted by the Voluntary Health Association of India, (VHAI) in the 35 identified villages.
In this convention presentations were made regarding various themes relating to the subjects from the view point of Aayurveda and independently from the viewpoint of modern medicine.
It is advised that the man and woman should be of different gothras or clans and only then the child born to them would be healthy and strong.
It is most important that the man and wife are both in a good mental state i.e. with feelings like - anger, fright, jealousy or hatred.
It is of course obvious that the interaction between the Lok Swaasthya Paramparaas and the ISMS has to be in the nature of a dialogue.
Local practices that were recorded during the LSPSS Survey as well as other surveys in the literature have been commented upon.
LSPSS was decided that a detailed survey would be undertaken to elicit information regarding various traditional practices in the area of Mother and Child Health.
Measurable results at the end of a 3-year period will show improvements in infant and maternal mortality.
Mobile Health Teams provides treatment of common diseases and a village level referral centre, and also technical backup for the primary level team of village based health workers.
Most of these studies have been done by practitioners of modern systems of medicine, with training in fields like Nutrition, Obstetrics, Gynecology, Pediatrics and Community Health.
On the fourth day she should have abhyanga snaanam (head-bath after applying oil) and water apparel.
On the one hand the input from ISMS can help us to make an assessment and evaluation of the Lok Swaasthya Parmaparaas - this would help to strengthen these traditions by confirming what sound is, complete what is incomplete and to identify any distortions.
One such example is the study of traditional child rearing practices of Nepal.
Parenting can be complicated and is frequently a difficult job.
Pfizer has adopted 35 villages in rural Haryana for a Primary Healthcare Program.
Pfizer has been supporting the Arpana Research and Charities Trust, in rural Haryana, since June 2002, for a three-year term, with the objective of conducting an effective Mother and Child Primary Health Care initiative to reduce anaemia in pregnant women and adolescent girls.
Pneumonia and other chest conditions; diarrhoea with extreme dehydration; and renal and other stones endemic in the area.
Prevent the growing incidence and burden of Sexually Transmitted Diseases.
Primary Healthcare Program also promotes community health covering diarrhoea management, antenatal care, child nutrition, immunisation etc.
Primary Healthcare Program provides services for women and girls (including reproductive health care and care of adolescent girls) and child care services.
Primary Level - Village Health Workers: Community based preventive health services, implemented by closely knit teams of primary level community workers from villages, including the traditional midwife.
Prince Charles visits Pfizer’s Community Health Care Project in Haryana during his recent visit to India in October 2003.
Prince Charles, walked through the streets of the village, visited several houses and interacted with a number of people, including women and children.
Reduction in child and maternal mortality is a target of the programme.
Secondary Level - Mobile Health Teams: Mobile clinics, linked to the referral base, visit all the project villages monthly to deliver a wide range of health care services for mother and child, including immunisation, and family planning components.
She should not pare her nails, should not wipe or apply collyrium.
Smaller families that would ensure better living standards.
Some of the mental faculties are also derived from the previous birth (poorva jenma vaasana).
Some of the qualities of a person are derived from saathmya, satwa and rajas.
Studies that have evaluated these practices from the perspective of Indigenous Systems of Medicine (ISM) are quite rare.
Substantial immunisation coverage; growth monitoring of children; and identification and management of infectious diseases, diarrhoea, childhood pneumonia, etc.
Such practices need to be studied further and understood.
Tertiary Level - Referral to the 170-bed Arpana Hospital: Patients and pregnant women are referred to the hospital by midwives and health workers who are based at the target villages.
The Arpana Research and Charities Trust was founded in 1980, specifically for promoting health and rural development.
The Arpana Research and Charities Trust’s uniqueness is its composition of approximately 70 people of diverse nationalities and religions who have pledged themselves to a singular purpose – Rural health care.
They differ emotionally and in their temperament based on their place in the family, their biology, as well as the culture and the experiences in which they are raised.
The factors contributed by saatmya are freedom from diseases, absence of idleness, absence of greed, normal voice, normal complexion, normal seed, constant happiness, brain, perspicuity of indriyas, high quality of ojas, longevity, strength and energy.
The first twelve nights after the cessation of the menstrual flow are considered to be the proper (best) period for conception.
The following are some of the key findings, with the improvements achieved by the end of the second year and the targets for the third year, i.e., 2004.
The incidence of low birth weight in infants is 35 to 45%.
The infant mortality rate is 90 per 1000 live births.
The information that was thus gathered was analysed and evaluated from the view point of Aayurveda.
The marriageable age of the man and woman have also been specified as twenty years and sixteen years respectively for getting healthy progeny.
The parts derived from the father are hair (scalp), beard, moustache, body hair, teeth, bones, veins, tendons, arteries, semen and nails.
The Prasnopanishad states that "Praanam vaa ethy praskadanthi ye diva rathya sanyujanthe; brahmacharymeva tadyadrathrau rathya sanjujyanthe" i.e. "Those who cohabit with their wives in the daytime lose their vitality and those who restrict this to the night time remain brahmachaaris".
The prince also met the village's 20 midwives and saw how the Arpana Trust was working with locals to educate them in skills such as midwifery.
The program targets the reduction of anaemia in pregnant women, adolescent girls, and those with diseases linked to anaemia.
The project covers 35 villages in and around Karnal district, Haryana, and a population of approximately 60,000 persons.
The purpose of this monograph is to present in a summarised form the traditional approach to - "Garbhini Charya”: the care of pregnant woman.
The qualities derived from the mother are: skin, blood, muscles, fat, umbilicus, hrudaya, pancreas, liver, spleen, kidney, urinary bladder and bone marrow.
The rasajabhaavas are the origin of body or manifestation of different body parts, growth of body, attachment of life or strength with body, contentment nourishment, enthusiasm or zeal, energy or strength, health, unhealthy state, complexion, maintenance of body and greedlessness.
The sources of these mahaabhoothas are said to be the mother, father, rasa and aatma.
The subject of mother and child health begins very much earlier than the time of conception.
The subject of Mother and Child Health is a very important one on which there is widespread traditional knowledge in the community.
The training of dais is now an essential part of the maternal and child health programme not only in India but also in over fifty other countries.
Thereafter the garbha is formed with all the gyaanendriyaas and karmendriyaas (sensory and motor organs) and endowed with the excellence of strength, complexion and mental faculties, by the time of delivery.
These workers help change practices in health, gender equality, environmental sanitation, mother and childcare, care of the handicapped, mobilisation of women, and increasing people's accessibility to education, employment, and income generation.
This garbha is nourished by the wholesome rasa (final product of digestion of the mother’s food) and maintained by proper regimen (of the mother).
This is also special in as much as it is here that Government has (however grudgingly) taken note of existence of Local Health Practitioners namely dais.
This is so, because the quality of the aarthava (the secretion of the female genital organs) and that of the shukra (the semen) are reflected in the product of conception.
This is unique in the sense that this perhaps is the area where the largest body of specialised traditional health practitioners exist namely dais.
To maintain a healthy womb and normal aarthava one should observe certain regimen during the rithu kaala (during menstruation or menstrual periods).
We can find examples in epics like Mahabharatha about instances where the mother either due to aversion or due to fright is not in a balanced state of mind, resulting in the birth of defective children like Drutharashtra (who was born blind) and Paandu (who was born weak and defective).
We hope that such an interaction will also infuse more dynamism into our ISMs and update their practice.
When the shukra (of a healthy man) comes into contact with the aarthava (of a healthy lady with unaffected garbhaashaya), during the fertile period, then the jeeva (soul) along with the mind descends into it to form the garbha.
While describing the contra indications of coitus Bhaavamisra includes cohabitation with a woman of the same gothra.
While enumerating the restrictions on who can be a marriage partner, the Dharmashaasthras also specify - "Asapindaa cha yaa mathurasagothra cha ya pithuh" i.e. "(One can marry a person who is not a sapinda to one's mother and not of the same gothra as one's father").

A child's temperament and maternal depressive symptoms were found to be similar to the use of and quality of child care in terms of their strength in predicting mother-child interactions.
A designated parent is selected in households where both parents are present to report child care arrangements for each child.
According to the findings, children who regularly spend time in non-maternal care have "somewhat less positive" interactions with their mothers than children who spend less or no time in non-maternal care.
Age shifting occurs when a child’s birthday falls between the enrollment period for a child care program (i.e. school, Head Start, etc.) and the period that the SIPP survey takes place.
Although the setting of the care (home/center/relative's home) did not alter the results, the quality of the care did.
Although the study was not designed to be nationally representative, the average income of study families was similar to the average national household income.
APA's membership includes more than 159,000 researchers, educators, clinicians, consultants and students.
Based on data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care, a longitudinal study of approximately 1,300 children.
Because of its large sample size, the NICHD study data allowed researchers to detect relatively small associations between child care and children.
Because the child care experience is not independent of children's family background, the researchers also studied the family influences on the quality of mother-child interaction.
Beginning with the 1996 SIPP panel, child care data was collected about all arrangements for all children under the age of 15, regardless of parental labor force status.
Both "maternal sensitivity" and "child engagement" describe behaviors that were observed and rated by the staff of the NICHD Study of Early Child Care.
Child care providers can be broadly classified as being relatives or non relatives of children.
Child engagement and positive mood during mother-child interaction were also rated.
Child engagement refers to how connected or involved a child appeared to be when relating to his or her mother.
Children participating in the study were placed in a variety of child care arrangements, ranging from the most informal (care with relatives) to the most formal (center care).
Confidence necessary to succeed in their present environment, and to deal with later responsibilities in school and in life.
Designated parents include biological, step- and adoptive parents, or other relatives/non-relatives acting as a guardian in the absence of parents.
Each child is treated as an individual in an inclusive community that values, respects, and responds to diversity.
Earlier SIPP panels only collected data on the primary and secondary child care arrangements for a limited number of children, and usually only for employed parents.
Enrollment in kindergarten/grade school and time spent in self-care are shown in the tables for informational purposes even though they are not considered to be child care arrangements.
Families and their children were recruited from 10 research sites across the United States.
For example, a five-year child enrolled in Head Start who turns six by the time of the survey would be out of universe for the Head Start question at interview date, resulting in an undercount of children in Head Start.
For example, when child care providers talk to children, encourage them to ask questions, respond to children's questions, read to them, challenge them to attend to others' feelings.
Further information about Head Start enrollment can be found at the Office of Head Start.
Head Start is a national program that promotes school readiness by enhancing the social and cognitive development of children through the provision of educational, health, nutritional, social and other services to enrolled children and families.
Head Start offers parents opportunities and support for growth, so that they can identify their own strengths, needs and interests, and find their own solutions.
Head Start programs promote school readiness by enhancing the social and cognitive development of children through the provision of educational, health, nutritional, social and other services to enrolled children and families.
Head Start serves families within the context of the community, and recognizes that many other agencies and groups work with the same families.
Head Start's commitment to wellness embraces a comprehensive vision of health for children, families, and staff.
higher quality care settings may provide mothers with positive role models for involved, sensitive interactions with their child
Higher quality child care was associated with increased maternal sensitivity.
If neither parent is in the household, the guardian is the designated parent.
If the mother is not available for an interview, proxy responses are accepted from the father or husband.
In a just-published analysis about mother-child interaction, the study showed that the number of hours infants and toddlers spent in child care was modestly linked to the sensitivity of the mother to her child, as well as to the engagement of the child with the mother in play.
In addition, the term multiple arrangements is used to designate children in more than one child care arrangement on a regular basis.
In addition, to put the issue of child care quality and stability into an appropriate context, the authors looked at other predictors of mother-child interactions.
In FY 1995, the Early Head Start program was established to serve children from birth to three years of age in recognition of the mounting evidence that the earliest years matter a great deal to children's growth and development.
In married-couple families, the mother is the designated parent.
In single-parent families, the resident parent is the designated parent.
In the just-published article the authors found that the results for child care hours and child care quality were not influenced by whether the child was in one form of child care or another.
Information collected on child care through SIPP has evolved over the years to include comprehensive data on child care use, cost, and receipt of government assistance.
It also includes family day care providers who are non-relatives who care for one or more unrelated children in the provider’s home.
Kindergarten/grade school is also included in the organized care total for children under 5 years.
Maternal sensitivity refers to how attuned a mother is to the child's wants and needs.
Moreover, the link between time spent in child care and mother-child interaction is equivalent to the link between maternal depression and maternal sensitivity.
Most of the earlier studies observed only a small number of children, measured the behavior of only one age group, and failed to include children with a very small number of hours in non maternal care.
Mother and child interactions were videotaped in 10-15 minutes sessions when the children were 6, 15, 24, and 36 months of age for almost a total of one hour for each of the nearly 1,300 children for whom the authors had complete information.
Mothers were rated in terms of their sensitivity to the child when the child was not distressed.
Non-relatives include in-home babysitters, neighbors, friends, and other non-relatives providing care either in the child's or the provider’s home.
Observers rated the degree of sensitivity of the mother, the degree of her intrusiveness, and the degree of positive regard or respect she showed toward the child.
On July 11, 2006, the Office of Head Start announced the launch of the Early Childhood Learning and Knowledge Center (ECLKC).
Organized care includes day care, nursery or preschool, and federal Head Start programs for those 5 years and younger.
Please take time to bookmark the site, visit it often and share with us your comments and suggestions.
Previous studies on whether the amount of time children spend in child care affected interactions with their mothers had conflicting results.
Relatives include mothers, fathers, siblings, grandparents, and other relatives such as aunts, uncles, and cousins.
Significant emphasis is placed on the involvement of parents in the administration of local Head Start programs.
Some parents may not be able to specify an arrangement that is used on a regular basis at least once a week and may reply as having no regular arrangement.
Such predictors of the quality of mother-child interaction include family income, maternal education, maternal depression, and mothers' marital status (or the status of having a partner).
The American Psychological Association (APA), in Washington, DC, is the largest scientific and professional organization representing psychology in the United States and is the world's largest association of psychologists.
The authors looked at associations between the amount, quality and stability of child care and mother-child interactions when the children were 6, 15, 24 and 36 months old.
The authors point out that the findings of a small negative association between mother-child interaction and hours of care and a small positive association with quality of care may suggest that linkages with child care are more a product of mothers who use child care than a consequence of the care itself.
The building of trusting, collaborative relationships between parents and staff allows them to share with and to learn from one another.
The child care data presented in the detailed tables come from the fourth interview of the 2004 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Panel conducted between February and May of 2005, and refer to child care arrangements used in the month prior to the interview.
The design and implementation of the SIPP child care module may lead to a certain amount of age shifting.
The ECLKC offers relevant, timely information, knowledge and learning to Head Start programs and the early childhood community in an easy-to-use format.
The ECLKC will grow and evolve over the next several years and is designed to be a comprehensive resource for anyone involved with or interested in early childhood education.
The findings appear in the November issue of Developmental Psychology.
The findings may also suggest that mothers who are more sensitive choose higher quality care for their children.
The findings may indicate that longer hours of child care are associated with some diminished familiarity and less ability of mother and child to be "in tune" with each other.
The findings may indicate that mothers who are less sensitive to their infants' signals or who have children who are less engaging use child care for more hours.
The greater maternal sensitivity is a function of the effect of the higher quality child care on the child's emerging verbal skills, behavior compliance and social competence.
The Head Start program provides grants to local public and private non-profit and for-profit agencies to provide comprehensive child development services to economically disadvantaged children and families.
The input of the Head Start community is critical to the future development of the ECLKC.
The investigators found a modest link between quality of child care and maternal sensitivity, meaning that the better the quality of child care the higher the level of maternal sensitivity.
The more hours a child spends during the first three years of life in non-maternal care the less positive the child's interactions with his/her mother.
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care has established that there is no consistent relation between the hours infants and toddlers spend in child care.
The NICHD Study of Early Child Care enrolled just over 1,300 children at birth at 10 research sites throughout the United States.
The objective of Child Health and Development Services is to ensure that, through collaboration among families, staff, and health professionals, all child health and developmental concerns are identified.
The objective of Community Partnerships is to ensure that grantee and delegate agencies collaborate with partners in their communities, in order to provide the highest level of services to children and families.
The objective of Education and Early Childhood Development is to provide all children with a safe, nurturing, engaging, enjoyable, and secure learning environment, in order to help them gain the awareness, skills.
The objective of Family Partnerships is to support parents as they identify and meet their own goals, nurture the development of their children in the context of their family and culture, and advocate for communities that are supportive of children and families of all cultures.
The percentage of ethnic minorities participating in the study was similar to the percentage of minorities in the nation as a whole.
The quality of the interaction between the mother and her child was assessed in terms of the mother's sensitivity to her child and in terms of the child's engagement with his or her mother during the joint play sessions.
The study is being conducted by investigators at the NICHD and at 14 universities around the country.
The universe of respondents in the SIPP child care module consists of adults who are the parents of children under 15 years old.
The varied experiences provided by the program support the continuum of children's growth and development, which includes the physical, social, emotional, and cognitive development of each child.
They engage parents in their children's learning and help them in making progress toward their educational, literacy and employment goals.
This finding is similar to earlier findings from the same study, showing that higher quality of care is associated with more favorable consequences than lower quality of care.
This link between increased time a child spent in non maternal care and decreased quality of the mother-child interaction is smaller than the link between the higher level of the mother's education.
This link is sufficiently small so that it can be detected only under conditions in which other predictors of the quality of mother-child interaction are equivalent or are accounted for statistically.
Through its divisions in 50 subfields of psychology and affiliations with 58 state, territorial and Canadian provincial associations, APA works to advance psychology as a science, as a profession and as a means of promoting human welfare.
To different ways of thinking--children's language abilities and thinking skills are better than under conditions that are less enriched.
To foster the development of a continuum of family centered services, and to advocate for a community that shares responsibility for the healthy development of children and families of all cultures.
To present a comprehensive view of the regular weekly experiences of children under 15 years old, this report also shows the incidence of children enrolled in school and enrichment activities (such as sports, lessons, clubs, and after- and before-school care programs).
Twenty-four percent of the recruited families were members of an ethnic minority.
Variation in the number of hours in child care was related to both the mother's behavior toward her children and the children's positive engagement of the mother in their interactions.
We look forward to working with all of you to make this a resource that will change and improve the way we all do business.
When families are not similar in terms of these other predictors of the quality of mother-child interaction, the link between hours spent in child care and mother-child interaction can be difficult to detect.
With your assistance, we can make the ECLKC one of the most valuable tools available to the Early Childhood community.
6 children currently receiving vocational training: 2 tailoring, 2 car repairs, 1 electrical and 1 printing.
A nurse travels between villages, supporting the health workers and providing education and medical care.
Along with the industrial and commercial growth in the city, has come many problems, in particular the emergence of many new slums and the increase of street children.
Although the Government has promised to provide health services to each and every village of the state, but due to lack of proper communication systems many tribal villages are still inaccessible.
As well as providing a safe place for the children to stay and food for them to eat.
At the centre there is a tailoring course, where the boys can learn to make things such as bags and soft toys.
At the same time, the amount of slum areas, as well as the number of children living on the streets has also grown.
Bangalore City has grown to be one of the major industrial and commercial centres in India.
Childcare centres to provide general health care, as well as regular check ups at least every six months.
Children under 5 to take part in a nutritional supplement program to fight against malnutrition.
Developing a nutritional supplement program for all children under the age of five.
Disease and malnutrition are wide spread and every day children are dying of preventable and curable illnesses.
Funding a health clinic staffed by qualified nurses which services the villages.
Helping the health workers and village elders to develop a relationship with different government bodies.
Here most of our pregnant women are following the precautions except a few who can’t take rest during this period due to their family problems.
Holding health checkups every six months for all women and children.
In 2002, there were 40 children actually living at the centre full time, with the rest of the children coming to the centers on a daily basis.
In 2005 UCOA sent $26,383 to Bangalore to support this project.
It is estimated that there are approximately 45,000 street children in the city.
It is giving them an alternative to the poverty and destruction they are caught up in.
It was a rainy evening when Madhu of Nuaguda village, in the tribal Koraput district of Orissa, went into labour.
It was my first child and I was totally unaware of newborn care.
Kamala Khilo is one among six women of Nuaguda village who has received the Mother and Child Protection Care training organised by the ANKUR initiative of UNICEF.
Kamala Khilo, a Self Help Group member of the same village came to Madhu’s rescue and took her to the district hospital, about 70 kms from the village.
Kamala Khilo, who saved the life of Madhu and her child herself had been a victim of such ignorance.
Kamala silently waited for the doctor to come out of the Operation Theatre.
Madhu’s condition turned critical but her family was reluctant to take her to the hospital.
Maliguda is yet another village emulating the Nuaguda example.
Many government development initiatives have bypassed these tribal areas as they are so isolated and transport is always a major problem.
Many of the children earn money working as rag pickers, fruit vendors, boot polishers and pick pocketers.
Many of the children living on the streets are illiterate and have had little or no education.
Many of the street children in Bangalore have come to the city in search of employment and a new start.
Many of them are illiterate or have had very little education.
Melghat and Churni are two of the most isolated and disadvantaged areas in the state of Maharashtra.
Melghat and Churni, the two areas where the project is taking place, are located in the Satpura mountain ranges in the Amravati District of Maharashtra State.
More than 450 children have been helped to this project for children.
Most of our children were not immunized in those days. Now UNICEF and its training have opened our eyes.
Most of the children have already dropped out of school and if they do not want to return, the staff encourage them to learn other skills.
Most of them have no family network to rely on for support.
Now all four pregnant women have had their babies in the hospital and no woman wants to deliver at home anymore.
Otherwise all the 21 children in our village are immunized by now and four women out of six had institutional delivery.
Running the health centre and paying for staff, nutritional supplements for the children, training of village health workers.
She lost her first child because the untrained Dai cut the child’s umbilical cord just after his birth with a sharp piece of tile.
She was in an advanced stage of delivery and had developed complications that the untrained village Dai (traditional midwife) could not handle.
Since maternal mortality and infant mortality rates are pretty high in Koraput, this kind of initiative definitely helps in bringing about a change in the long term.
Social workers and other staff from the centre meet the children at designated spots throughout the city, such as train stations and markets.
Some needs of children of are food and clothing, blankets and bedding, resources for the training courses, counseling services.
Some of the villages in the region are completely inaccessible by road because of the mountainous conditions, and other villages are at times completely cut off from the outside world due to bad weather.
Still not convinced, Madhu’s husband was very annoyed and threatened Kamala that if anything should happen to Madhu or the child then he would kill her.
Suka Ram, Madhu’s husband apologized to Kamala and handed over his newborn son to her saying that the baby belonged to her as it was only because of her that the child and mother survived.
The Amravati District is about 200km west of Nagpur, the 2nd city of the state (Mumbai is the capital).
The Children in Crisis project is a project of the Church of South India (CSI), one of our partner churches in India.
The Children in Crisis project is an activity of the Uniting Church in Australia's partner church, the Church of South India .
The Children in Crisis project is focused around two main centres, both located in the middle of the city.
The Children in Crisis project is located in the middle of Bangalore City in the south of India.
The city itself has a population of 5.2 million people.
The doctor also thanked Kamala for bringing Madhu to the hospital in time, as otherwise, it would have been difficult to save her life.
The establishment of ten childcare centres in the villages.
The fourth day of training was about pre -school education, girls’ education, handling dropout children, water and sanitation.
The Karnataka Central Diocese, in which Bangalore is located, coordinates the project.
The main centre is called 'Makkala Ashraya Kendra' which means 'shelter of refuge for children who are in crisis'.
The Mother and Child care program is a program of the Church of North India, a partner church of the Uniting Church in Australia.
The Nagpur Diocese of the Church of North India is responsible for coordinating the Mother and Childcare project.
The objective of the project is to promote mother and child care in two of the most isolated and disadvantaged tribal areas in Nagpur – Melghat and Churni.
The people here are suffering and UCOA believes that we should support our partner, the Church of North India in their mission to build a society where each person, including the poor, the oppressed and the marginalised, have access to the basic necessities of life.
The project also encourages the children to return to school and gain an education, or to undertake vocational training programs to help them gain employment.
The project consists of a number of different sections - Training programs to teach mothers about basic nutrition and preventative health care.
The project is currently in its seventh year and in 2006, UCOA has made a commitment to provide $22,500 in financial support.
The project works with children living on the streets of Bangalore City.
The second centre was established in the second half of 2002, and is a day centre located in a hall that a local church has allowed the project to use.
The SHG members of Maliguda have also received the training and are implementing the regimen in their village.
The SHG members visit each and every household and motivate pregnant women to take care of themselves as well as make them aware of the immunization necessary for the children.
The staff try to build relationships with the children and encourage them to visit the centre.
The street children are easily drawn in to gangs and then become involved in violence and petty theft.
The street children in Bangalore have great needs for their life.
The train station was chosen as one of the meeting spots, as a way for staff to meet children that are arriving in Bangalore from other cities.
The tribal community needs to be aware of the fact that to some extent their ignorance about mother and childcare is also responsible for the high MMR and IMR in the district.
There are a number of ways that the project aims to improve and encourage mother and childcare in the tribal villages.
There are also other courses outside the centre, such as carpentry, driving and motor mechanics, that other boys attend.
There are currently 650 slums in Bangalore that are recognized by the Government.
These children are bored, they have no purpose in life and so they simply roam the streets looking for things to do.
They are also informing them about sanitation and mother / childcare.
They were also trained in care of children from 0 to 3 years.
This often results in them becoming involved in street gangs and crime to past the time.
This project aims to give children an alternative to this type of life on the streets.
This project is encouraging children to gain an education or vocational skills to help them find meaningful employment.
This training has been imparted to the women from the 60 self-help groups of 67 villages in Potangi block.
Today in this village all the children have been immunized. Prior to the training, there were just no institutional deliveries, although the local PHC (Primary Health Centre) is just one kilometre away.
Training local women as basic health workers to teach preventative healthcare.
UCOA began its support of the Mother and Childcare project in 2002.
UCOA has provided a motorbike to enable her to travel to the villages.
Under the four-day training programme, the SHG members were taught about pre and post natal care for the mother and care of the newborn infant from 0 to 6 months of age.
Under this training programme we have not only given them training on mother and child care but also taught them to monitor the process on their own and to spread awareness among others in the village.
We used to think that immunization is harmful for newborns so we used to hide our children when the doctors came to our village.
While describing this incident, a quiet joy gleamed on Kamala’s face.
With ongoing support the centers can give these children the encouragement they need to gain an education or vocational skills, as well as providing them with much needed emotional support.
19 million infants in the developing world have low birth weight (less than 2500 grams). 8.3 million are in India.
27 percent of children under five years have a birth certificate in India.
About 25 per cent of children under age five in the world are underweight.
About 38 per cent of children in the developing countries are initiated to breastfeeding within one hour of birth.
Whether the outbreak is due to hepatitis A or E, the measures for prevention and control are similar.
11 more species of mosquito have been incriminated as vectors of JE.
A fourfold rise in IgG antibody titre in paired sera taken at an interval of 10 days or more is confirmatory.
A killed JE vaccine is produced at the Central Research Institute (CRI), Kasauli from the brain of suckling mice inoculated with the Nakayama JE strain.
A surveillance system should be established so that any case of encephalopathy is immediately reported to the local health authorities.
Active surveillance through key individuals in the community should be encouraged in the high risk pockets, for example, places where piggeries are commercially established.
Acute viral hepatitis is such a sufficiently distinct clinical syndrome that it usually poses no difficulty in diagnosis.
Although, infected pigs do not manifest any overt symptoms of disease they develop tremendous viraemia and can infect the mosquitoes the pigs are considered as amplifying hosts.
An increase in the incidence of diarrhea and/or typhoid fever, and poor water quality indicate impending epidemic of viral hepatitis.
Antigen for conducting the tests is not yet commercially available.
Blood for serological studies should be carefully collected taking due universal precautions.
By analogy, viral hepatitis E is likely to follow an increase in acute diarrhea or typhoid fever following water contamination.
Case fatality rate is high in severe cases It is of 20 to 40% have been recorded.
Culex mosquitoes are zoophilic, feeding primarily on animals and wild birds.
Culex mosquitoes can fly for long distances (1-3 kms or even more).
Culex mosquitoes generally breed in water bodies with luxuriant vegetation.
Culex mosquitoes rest outdoors in vegetation and other shaded places but in summer may also rest indoors.
Disturbances of sensorium are reflected as lethargy, somnolence, irritability, apathy or loss of consciousness.
Ensuring that a separate sterile syringe and needle is used for each injection.
Epidemics usually coincide with the monsoons and post-monsoon period when the vector density is high.
Epidemiological and entomological investigations are useful in leading to a presumptive diagnosis of JE.
Female Culex mosquitoes can transmit the virus to other hosts after an extrinsic incubation period of 9 to 12 days.
Female Culex mosquitoes get infected after feeding on a viraemic host.
Geographical distribution-Identify the area or group affected by the outbreak-attack rates in different areas will indicate the points where contamination is occurring.
Horses are unlikely source of mosquito infection.
Horses develop active disease but viraemia is rarely present in high titre or for long periods.
IEC activities for minimising the risk of faeco-orally transmitted diseases should be undertaken in the community.
If an outbreak of JE is suspected it must be reported immediately to the district health office.
If field investigations indicate malariogenic, conditions illness is clinically compatible and anti-malaria treatment is effective, a probable digresses of malaria in made.
Immediate measures are called for to reduce the density of mosquitoes by spray of insecticides.
In areas where water supply is intermittent, on-line-booster pumps can create negative pressure in the pipeline leading to suction of sewage into the water pipeline.
In endemic areas, sporadic cases may occur throughout the year.
In human beings, viraemia is mild and lasts for a short duration.
Infection in man appears to be correlated with living in close proximity with animal reservoirs, especially pigs.
Insist that a glass syringe and needle are boiled for 20 minutes before reuse OR a sealed disposable syringe and needle is used.
Irrigated rice fields, shallow ditches and pools are common breeding places of Culex mosquitoes.
Isolation of patients and disinfection of secretions and excretions are not required as JE virus is not transmitted from person to person.
Isolation of virus from blood is almost impossible as viraemia is mild and of short duration.
Isolation of virus from CSF is not routinely done for diagnostic purposes.
It is emphasized that the only way to reduce mortality due to JE is proper clinical management of cases.
It is, therefore important, that cases of JE are referred to a hospital as early as possible if encephalitis is suspected.
Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is a disease of public health importance because of its epidemic potential and high case fatality rate.
Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic disease.
Japanese Encephalitis is caused by a group B arbovirus (flavivirus).
JE virus has its natural cycle in wild or domestic vertebrates and mosquitoes.
JE’s epidemics have also been reported in peri-urban areas where similar conditions may exist.
Long-term measures include the recommended steps for vector control under the National Malaria Eradication Programme (NMEP).
Maintain surveillance for acute diarrhea, typhoid fever, and jaundice cases.
Man is an incidental host of Japanese Encephalitis (JE)’s virus.
Man to man transmission of JE has not been documented.
Manage the existing increase in diarrhea and/or typhoid fever cases, and take corrective measures to prevent the impending outbreak of viral hepatitis.
Mosquitoes belonging to the Culex vishnui group (Culex vishnui, Culex pseudovishnui, Culex tritaeneorhynchus) are the most important vector species in India.
Necessary field investigations must be carried out in the area of residence of the patient to check for amplifying host and vector.
One of the complications of P.falciparum malaria is encephalopathy.
Patients should be referred to the district hospital as the peripheral health facilities may not have adequate resources to manage serious cases.
Patients who recover from the acute episode may have neurological sequelae.
Periodic sanitary surveys should be undertaken, especially before monsoon, for sewer overflow, and leakage in water supply system.
Pigs are the major vertebrate hosts of JE virus.
Pockets of high risk should be identified so that these areas could be given more attention with regard to control measures, health educational activities and field supervision.
Regular monitoring of water quality by examination of water samples for residual chlorine and/or coliform organisms on a random basis.
Since malaria is relatively common, the diagnosis of malaria should be considered.
Such areas would include villages and peri-urban areas where pigs are reared, especially if these are close to paddy fields which are rich breeding places for Culex mosquitoes.
Supportive treatment and good nursing care can significantly reduce case fatality rate of JE.
The clinical features of JE are those of encephalitis.
The Culex mosquitoes remain infected for life and the average life period of a mosquito is about 21 days.
The currently available evidence does not indicate major role of cattle in transmission of JE.
The diagnosis of Japanese Encephalitis is confirmed by laboratory tests.
The diagnosis of JE is supported by serological tests.
The facilities for preparation and examination of blood slides should be made available at each PHC.
The first major outbreak of JE occurred in Bankura and Burdwan districts, West Bengal, in 1973 and since then it has spread to many states/UTs of country.
The incubation period in man, following Culex mosquitoes bite probably varies from 5 to 15 days.
The infection of JE is transmitted through the bite of an infected culicine mosquito.
The isolation or destruction of the amplifying hosts (usually pigs), which are the main source of infection, is not practical as these animals do not show any overt signs of illness and it is not possible to identify infected animals.
The mosquitoes are outdoor as well as indoor feeders.
The patient may develop difficulty of speech and other neurological deficits like ocular palsies, hemiplegia, tremor and ataxia.
The patient will give a history of acute onset with fever and change in behavior or sensorium lasting for more than 24 hours.
The presence of risk factors such as the vector and amplifying hosts supports the diagnosis of JE.
The preventive measures are directed at reducing the vector density and in taking personal protection to prevent the bite of mosquitoes.
The public should also be informed to take necessary precautions against mosquito bite such as use of full sleeved clothes, mosquito nets at night and mosquito repellent creams.
The recombinant DNA vaccine and the plasma derived should be administered as per recommendations by manufacturers.
The recombinant DNA vaccine and the plasma derived, both are safe and effective.
The recombinant DNA vaccine and the plasma derived, vaccines are available in single and multi-dose vials.
The risk increases in areas where ecological conditions facilitate transmission to man.
The tests include detection of IgM antibodies which appear after the first week of onset of symptoms and are detectable for one to three months after the acute episode.
The total number of overt cases per village will be a few and the local health personnel must be alert about any case(s) of encephalopathy in their areas.
The transmission of JE virus cycle is maintained in animals and birds.
The virus is antigenically related to other flaviviruses including dengue, west nile and yellow fever viruses.
The virus of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) infects mainly animals and birds.
There are other diseases which have shorter incubation period and are also transmitted by faeco-oral route.
There are two types of hepatitis B vaccines available - the recombinant DNA vaccine and the plasma derived
There is no evidence that gammaglobulins or corticosteroids have a beneficial effect.
There is no specific treatment of Japanese ncephalitis.
They are acute watery diarrhea (incubation period: a few days) and typhoid fever (incubation period: 1-3 weeks).
Though JE is primarily a disease of rural agricultural areas, where vector mosquitoes proliferate in close association with pigs and other animal reservoirs.
Treatment should start without waiting for serological laboratory results.
Typhoid fever is another important endemic disease which can give rise to symptoms mimicking Japanese Encephalitis.
Typhoid fever should be excluded by careful history and physical examination and blood culture for S.typhi, if necessary.
Vaccination of humans against JE is the only measure currently available for prevention of JE on long-term basis.
Viral hepatitis E has a long incubation period of usually 1-2 months (not less than 15 days).
Water birds such as pond herons, cattle egrets, poultry birds and ducks play a significant role in the natural history of JE virus.
When an outbreak occurs or when the risk of such outbreaks is high, the cooperation of other government departments, non-governmental agencies and the community often becomes necessary.
5 cases of similar illness of acute onset within an incubation period or one death in a village is being used as a criteria in one state to constitute an outbreak.
A list of the laboratories with full address, telephone and fax numbers along with the type of tests conducted is recommended to be maintained.
A map of the area or even a rough sketch can be drawn showing where each reported case resides to indicate geographical distribution of cases and to identify high risk pockets.
A single case of such diseases should be treated as an outbreak, e.g. poliomyelitis, guinea worm and yaws.
A thorough knowledge about clinical symptoms and epidemiological parameters is important for outbreak investigations.
Active surveillance is active search for cases.
Active surveillance should be maintained until the outbreak is over (usually it is when the double incubation period has elapsed after the last case).
Active surveillance through peripheral health personnel, personnel from other government departments, NGOs and key community representatives provides additional information about cases who may not have been seen at government health facilities.
After an outbreak has been confirmed, specific interventions will depend on the cause of the outbreak and mode of transmission.
After establishing the existence of an outbreak and verifying the diagnosis, it becomes important to accurately define and count the cases.
An effective surveillance system is essential or planning, implementation and monitoring the disease control programmes.
An effective surveillance system must be established in each district.
An important purpose of a surveillance system is to prevent outbreaks or detect them in the early stage, and therefore the health personnel must be responsive to the warning signals.
An outbreak or epidemic is defined as the occurrence in a community of cases of an illness clearly in excess of expected numbers.
Case fatality rate may increase due to certain factors such as high malnutrition rates in young children or limited knowledge in the community about the danger signs of severe illness.
Cases should be described in terms of age, sex, occupation, socio-economic parameters, migration, vaccination history and other relevant characteristics.
Cases tend to cluster, and it may also be useful to mark affected schools or other institutions on the map in addition to residential locations.
Collection of unnecessary samples is discouraged as it places a heavy load on the laboratory and some tests are very expensive.
Community level IEC activities should be supported so that key messages regarding the control of the diseases and prevention of outbreaks are known.
Concerned medical and health personnel should be trained in the principles of outbreak investigations including recognition of early warning signals, epidemiological and entomological parameters, differential diagnosis, laboratory support and specific control interventions.
Control measures are most effective when selective interventions are applied early.
Data should be regularly analyzed as suggested in a separate module "Surveillance of Epidemic Prone Diseases" available from National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD).
Depending on the disease and the resources available to investigate the outbreak, it may even be desirable to conduct house-to-house visits, especially in the homes of contacts of cases.
Differential diagnoses of some of the important and common clinical syndromes have been given in this document.
Diseases can also cause outbreaks with the potential to spread rapidly and cause many deaths.
Diseases for which eradication or elimination goals have been set.
During outbreaks, analysis of cases by time will help to document the trend of the epidemic and to monitor the effectiveness of the containment measures.
During the period of the outbreak, all the cases of the disease under consideration occurring in that area should be identified and listed.
Efforts therefore, should be made to investigate all the outbreaks as well as threatened oubreaks.
First reports about an outbreak will be based on clinical syndrome and diagnosis will be presumptive.
For easy reference, the epidemiological parameters should be available in tabular form.
For some diseases even a single case (acute poliomyelitis, guinea worm, unusual acute severe episode of an illness of unknown aetiology) constitutes an outbreak.
For some laboratory tests, samples may need to be sent to the state, regional or national levels.
Health education material which has been prepared in advance and field tested will be useful if there is an outbreak in the area because such material may be required at short notice.
If the outbreak is unusual, case fatality rates are very high, aetiology cannot be determined or if the clinical syndrome had not been reported in the area before, the state officer and NICD would be expected to assist the district authorities in investigations.
In case of endemic diseases, it is also useful to present previous data on a line graph.
In investigating an outbreak, it is necessary to provide a detailed description of outbreaks in terms of time, place and person.
In situations of doubt, whether an illness meets the case definition, a second opinion may be sought.
In some circumstances, community assistance may be enlisted for house-to-house visits.
In some situations, serial spot maps, by week or by month (or by disease generation) may provide insight into the pattern of the spread of the disease over time.
In the event of an outbreak, the state nodal officer is required to be notified immediately.
Increase in the total number of cases does not, however, necessarily indicate increase in the incidence of the disease.
Inventories should be checked before the expected seasonal increase of cases.
Investigations must be made, including epidemiological, entomological and laboratory, to rule out the more common causes first.
It is important that adequate facilities are established at the district level for rapid and efficient analysis of the surveillance data.
It is important that information from surveillance be recorded in a standardised manner.
It is necessary to know the clinical and epidemiological features of the diseases to effectively investigate and control outbreaks.
It is not necessary to collect specimen from all cases as it is not essential for the outcome of outbreak investigations and control measures.
It is useful to have a short list of `warning signals' which should trigger an investigation.
It might be useful to convene a meeting of the concerned departments, community representatives and the NGOs before the expected seasonal increase in cases of diseases.
It should be noted that during an outbreak a higher percentage of more severe cases may occur.
It will only be possible if mothers know about signs and symptoms of pneumonia i.e. increased respiratory rate and chest indrawing.
Laboratory confirmation of clinically-diagnosed cases or identification of the etiological agent may sometimes be necessary.
Many communicable diseases are endemic in India.
Many of diseases have seasonal and cyclic trends which can be discerned through the surveillance system.
Medical officers are encouraged to expand the list and include other conditions prevalent in their areas.
Mother must consult the health facilities whenever signs and symptoms of pneumonia appear for proper treatment of cases.
Much time and effort may be wasted due to misdiagnosis.
Oubreaks should be seen as excellent opportunities to analyse why they occur, identify high risk areas and groups, and evaluate control measures.
Outbreaks of new and reemerging infections may also occur.
Persons who are ill and meet the case definition for the outbreak disease should be entered onto what is called a "line-listing".
Precautionary measures need to be taken and decided where and when to seek medical help in a timely manner.
Precautionary measures taken in anticipation of an outbreak can prevent an acute public health emergency and save lives.
Since the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) is the nodal office at the national level, it is expected that notification of the outbreak would be made immediately to NICD, also indicating if any technical support is required.
Software such as EPI INFO are particularly useful in maintaining and analyzing line lists of cases of various diseases.
Some laboratory tests are expected to be done at the PHC level; others may be available only at the district level.
Some life saving medicines such as ORS packets may also be kept at the village level especially in the high risk pockets and areas which might become inaccessible during the monsoons.
Some mechanism for briefing the press should also be established.
Special emphasis must be placed on proper collection of clinical samples, their storage and transportation.
States and districts should establish criteria on the number of cases that constitute an epidemic based on their local situations.
Such analysis provides valuable epidemiological information regarding high risk groups, areas and factors.
Such graphs help to demonstrate the magnitude of the outbreak compared to the previous reported incidence, rapidity of spread of the disease and evaluation of control efforts.
Such help will be more forthcoming if mechanisms for interaction have been developed before the onset of an outbreak.
Such mappings may assist in identifying the sources of infection.
Suggestions have been made for clinical syndromes, outbreaks of which are more commonly reported.
Suspect case definition may be used to identify cases.
Telephone facilities are expected at the PHC level.
The district officers may also need technical and other support in the event of an unusual outbreak or if the diagnosis is not confirmed.
The epidemic curve can be helpful in identifying the index (first) case or cases, and may even suggest patterns or modes of transmission.
The first step of outbreak investigation is to confirm the diagnosis of as many reported cases as possible.
The information is also necessary to assess the quality of the national programmes (if relevant).
The majority of the cases are expected to fall within the standard case definitions.
The medical and health personnel should establish contact with community leaders and other key personnel in their areas which would be useful in receiving early warning signals and in soliciting community support during an outbreak.
The nodal officer and other key personnel should receive training in the use of computers.
The nodal officer at the district level, in consultation with the concerned programme officers, must ensure that essential supplies are in place in the peripheral health facilities and that adequate buffer stocks are maintained at the district level.
The nodal officer should identify gaps in laboratory services at each level that can be filled within the given resources.
The number of cases which are needed to be called an outbreak varies according to several factors.
The onset of illness of the cases should be graphed by hours (for example, in food poisoning), days, weeks or months, as appropriate.
The prevention and control of outbreaks require the close and active cooperation of the community.
The primary purpose of an outbreak investigation is to control the outbreak, limit its spread to other areas and assess how prevention strategies can be further strengthened to reduce or eliminate the risk of such outbreaks in the future.
The reported cases should be investigated by a medical officer to confirm the diagnosis.
Timely treatment and follow-up of cases and contacts is important to reduce mortality.
Under such a situation, samples should be collected carefully from a few selected cases.
Under the national disease surveillance programme, it is expected that the district and state levels will be linked to NICD through e-mail and fax.
Valuable information can be obtained by contacting key community representatives, especially if the outbreak is focal.
Variations in the number of reporting sites, completeness of reporting, geographical size of the catchment area and size of the population are factors that must be taken into consideration while analysing reports.
When an outbreak occurs or when the risk of such outbreaks is high, the cooperation of other government departments, non-governmental agencies and the community often becomes necessary.
While an outbreak is usually limited to a small focal area, an epidemic covers larger geographic areas and has more than one focal point.
While outbreaks cannot always be predicted or prevented, recognition of early warning signals, timely investigations and application of specific control measures can limit the spread of the outbreak and prevent deaths.
While preparing tables, the population characteristics, for example related to age and sex, should be grouped accordingly.
Action should be initiated based on clinical, epidemiological and entomological findings.
Alert health personnel and hospitals to report increase or clustering of cases or deaths.
All health facilities should maintain records of patients seen, including in OPD.
An effective surveillance system can provide an early warning signal and prevent outbreaks.
An important objective of outbreak investigations is to reduce mortality rates by early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.
Appropriate sterilisation of needles (boiling for at least 20 minutes) and screening of all blood donations for HBsAg, HIV.
Bubonic plague and visceral leishmaniasis are other important vector borne diseases.
Case fatality rates can be significantly reduced through effective Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT).
Chickenpox in higher age group is often serious and large number of patients need to be admitted in health facility, particularly Infectious Diseases Hospitals.
Community participation for safe practices with regard to storing water and food handling are essential to prevent outbreaks.
Control activities and treatment of patients should not be delayed pending laboratory confirmation of diagnosis.
Documentation of the epidemic is an important step in outbreak investigation.
During the course of investigations, universal infection control precautions are expected to be implemented.
Ensure that the health personnel are adequately trained and that the recommended guidelines are followed in the hospitals.
Entomological investigations are an important aspect of field investigations as a number of outbreaks are vector borne.
Entomological investigations are useful to confirm or rule out the probable cause of the outbreak, especially if results of laboratory tests are not available.
Food handlers and suspected food also need attention during investigations.
Food-borne diseases include food poisoning due to toxins produced by micro-organisms (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus) and chemicals, as well as food-borne infections (e.g. Salmonella infection).
Food-borne outbreaks are very common in our country.
For influenza and chickenpox, no vaccine is currently available in India and in absence of specific therapy, control of their outbreaks is a difficult proposition.
Health education and public awareness and co-operation are important to control an outbreak.
High vector density is a reflection of the unsatisfactory field implementation and monitoring of vector control measures.
High vector density is a warning signal as the risk of vector borne outbreaks increases under such conditions.
Ideally, the place of immunization should also be examined to assess quality of the cold chain.
If dengue fever/ dengue haemorrahagic fever is suspected or confirmed, vector surveillance and vector control activities should be taken up with high priority.
If information is available there is less likely to be panic and chaos, and community support will also be forthcoming.
If the community knows how the outbreak spreads and what measures they can take in their own families, the risks can be considerably reduced.
If there is a sudden increase in cases or clustering of cases in an area, field investigations should be carried out and necessary corrective action taken.
Immunization cards or immunization registers should be checked to verify the immunization status.
Immunization status is an important descriptive as well as analytical parameter.
In areas where leishmaniasis is prevalent or there is a potential threat of leishmaniasis or plague, vector monitoring and IEC activities are recommended.
In case of meningococcal meningitis, though a bivalent vaccine is available, it is not routinely used.
In fact, all the waterborne infections (viral, bacterial and parasitic) can be transmitted through contamination of food.
In large outbreaks, a sample of population may be interviewed, or the investigations may be by case control studies.
In outbreak of meningococcal meningitis, vaccination of selected high risk groups only is recommended.
In several countries, it has contributed to the emergence of antibiotic resistance, depriving severely ill patients from a valuable treatment.
In those who are immunized with two doses, protection lasts for 3-6 months only.
Inadequately sterilised needles and syringes, sharp instruments that penetrate the skin, and unscreened blood are common source of parenterally transmitted infections.
Information on immunization coverage may also be available through past vaccination coverage evaluation surveys.
Information on natural disasters like floods, cyclone, drought, earth quake etc., as available may be utilized for the description of the epidemic.
Injections can transmit a variety of infections including HIV and hepatitis B and C.
It is also important that the public and administrators are aware of inappropriate measures so that much time and resources are not diverted for measures which are ineffective.
It is more appropriate to determine attack rates rather than absolute numbers because rates take into account the variations in the population size of different groups.
It is not necessary while submitting the preliminary report to wait for the results of laboratory tests which have been sent to laboratories outside the district and which may take sometime.
It is particularly important to inform the public that most cases of epidemic prone diseases can be managed if treatment is started at the earliest.
It is suggested that action for preparation of health education material and key messages is taken for epidemic prone diseases.
Majority of the infected individuals have no symptoms.
Man-made situation like developmental projects on irrigation and industries may create environmental conditions conducive for disease transmission.
Mass chemoprophylaxis is not only ineffective in preventing the spread of the disease, but it also diverts manpower and resources from effective measures.
No country requires travelers to have a cholera vaccination certificate.
On the other hand, the risk is low if the density is maintained below critical levels.
Percentage Immunization coverage is estimated by dividing the total number of doses (measles and BCG) or third doses (OPV and DPT) of the vaccine administered to a specific age-group by the total population of that age-group in the affected village(s) or urban area.
Pigs are considered to be amplifying hosts of Japanese Encephalitis virus.
Procedures that require the collection of blood and other clinical samples should be undertaken carefully.
Publication of the report in a technical journal or newsletter will ensure wider accessibility to the information.
Rates of illness in those who did or did not consume a specific food item are compared, and relative risk is calculated for each food item.
Regular monitoring is essential to ensure that breeding sites are eliminated in a timely manner.
Results of some tests can be obtained locally and quickly.
Setting up check-posts requires massive inputs and diverts attention from other more useful control measures.
Similarly information on drinking water supply and Environmental sanitation is crucial for the investigation.
Some suggestions to develop the key messages are given in the documents on specific diseases.
Special emphasis must be placed on proper collection, labelling transportation and storage of clinical samples.
Such rates are generally computed by dividing the number of cases in a population group by the population size of the same group.
Such tests include water quality monitoring if a water-borne disease is suspected.
The Aedes mosquito (vector for dengue fever) is a domestic breeder preferring clean water containers.
The age-groups vaccinated should be fully assessed as inclusion of older children may give a false sense of higher coverage.
The control measures should be directed towards all stages of the life cycle of the vector.
The cooperation of the community is imperative to control mosquito breeding by taking simple precautionary measures.
The descriptive epidemiology will help to define the population groups at high risk of disease in terms of age-groups, geographical location, activity etc., immunisation status and other characteristics.
The determination of Immunization coverage levels is crucial if the outbreak is due to a vaccine preventable disease.
The factors that will influence decision will be the severity of the disease, its potential for spread to other areas, maximum incubation period and the accessibility of the affected area to routine health services.
The first three diseases are vaccine preventable and their outbreaks reflect poor immunization activity in the community.
The frequency and duration of follow-up visits will depend on many factors and decisions will have to be taken at the local level.
The immunization activities, including periodicity of the immunization sessions, quantities of vaccines received and cold chain system, should be reviewed.
The Immunization status in the community can be assessed through Immunization performance records available at the PHC.
The immunization status of each case must be carefully investigated to ascertain the number of doses of the vaccine received by the patient.
The implicated food would give the highest attack rates, and/or the highest relative risk.
The important air-borne diseases those can cause outbreaks are measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, chickenpox, meningococcal meningitis, and influenza.
The information will be useful in drawing up long term strategies for reducing the risk of the outbreaks in future and in more effective handling of the outbreak if it were to occur.
The local pradhan and panchayat members should be aware that if there is an acute case of fever with altered sensorium, the local health authorities should be notified immediately.
The main findings of the outbreak should also be discussed with the members of the rapid response team and the members of the inter-departmental committee.
The results can be added in the final report.
The results of laboratory investigations should be included in the outbreak investigation report.
The risk of some vector borne outbreaks increases in the presence of animals or birds.
The risk of vector borne diseases has increased in the urban and peri-urban areas due to the changing life styles and industrial activities which have made the surrounding environment more conducive for the breeding of mosquitoes and other vectors.
The study of environmental conditions and the dynamics of its interaction with the population and causative agents will help in the formulation of hypothesis on genesis of the epidemic, which will make the basis for the control measures to be taken.
The value of selective chemotherapy of household contacts is also doubtful.
Travel and trade restrictions between countries or different areas within a country do not prevent the spread of cholera.
Useful lessons can be learnt if the documentation is complete and data properly analysed.
Vaccination campaigns divert resources and manpower from more useful control activities.
Vaccines that are currently available against cholera do not have high vaccine efficacy rates.
Vector control measures should be applied as per the calendar of activities to optimize impact for prevention of outbreaks.
Vector surveillance should be immediately undertaken in other high risk pockets even if no case has been reported from the area.
Verbal history should be used only if such records cannot be obtained.
Where piggeries have been established, regular monitoring and periodic anti-vector measures are indicated.
Whereas in the past contaminated food processed in the home exposed a few individuals, the food processed and distributed extensively by the industry could result in the exposure of a large number of people.
While investigating an outbreak of food-borne infection, efforts should be made to interview all who are exposed for history of food consumption and illness, if any.
While investigating outbreaks of haemorrahagic fever or if parenteral route of transmission is suspected, protective gear such as gloves, masks etc. are expected to be worn by health personnel treating or investigating patients.
While the key messages will essentially remain the same for all areas, the language and style may need to be adapted to local needs.
With respect to physical environment, the data on rainfall, humidity and temperature are available in the district meteorological centers.
A case of meningitis usually presents with sudden onset of high grade fever, severe headache, stiff neck with or without altered sensorium.
A commercially available latex agglutination test may provide the aetiology of some agents of meningitis i.e. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae B, Meningococci AandC.
A lumber puncture for demonstration and/or isolation of organisms from CSF is essential.
A majority of Hepatitis E cases however, occur in young adults.
A mental apathy and dullness is common and delirium may develop.
Acute fever is caused by a variety of viruses.
Acute respiratory infections leading to pneumonia are major causes of morbidity and mortality in India, especially in early childhood.
Acute viral hepatitis is such a sufficiently distinct clinical syndrome that it usually poses no difficulty in diagnosis.
Acute watery diarrhoea in young children is the most common problem.
Although jaundice may occur due to many reasons, viral hepatitis is responsible for the majority of cases with jaundice in our country.
Although large number of cases are reported, TB meningitis is not expected to occur in the form of explosive outbreaks.
At least 6 agents (HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HEV and HGV) can cause viral hepatitis.
At this stage patient may present as fever with altered sensorium.
Cases are confirmed by serology for JE antibodies (demonstratin of IgM antibodies or four fold rise in IgG antibodies in paired serum samples).
Cases occur throughout the year, with a seasonal increase in the monsoon and post-monsoon months.
Cases of haemorrahagic fever are expected to be relatively rare and few in number.
Cases of shock syndrome have not been reported and case fatality rates are low.
Clinicians are aware of the need to report such cases immediately so that further field investigations could be carried out.
Clinicians must, however, keep in mind TB meningitis as a differential diagnosis, especially if the patient is a young child.
Clustering and sudden increase of acute cases of fever may be due to malaria, dengue fever or other viral fevers.
Death may occur within a few hours of severe episodes of acute watery diarrhoea.
Diagnosis can be confirmed by typical clinical presentation, age group affected and vaccination history (measles).
Disturbances of sensorium are reflected as lethargy, somnolence, irritability, apathy or loss of consciousness.
Due to rapid means of transport and increase in the number of travellers, there is a potential risk of importation of these infections.
Even a single case of encephalopathy therefore reflects a relatively large number of cases of the disease in the community.
Even if a clustering of a few cases in older children and adults is noticed, investigation should be initiated promptly for impending outbreaks of these infections so that appropriate action for treatment of cases and control of outbreak is promptly taken.
Feco-orally transmitted hepatitis E virus has been responsible for virtually all the outbreaks of viral hepatitis in India.
Fever with altered sensorium (encephalopathy) may occur as a result of complication of some diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, measles and pertussis.
Fever with rash may be due to measles or chicken pox.
Focal neurological deficits may or may not be present.
Focal outbreaks of acute watery diarrhoea can occur.
Haemorrhagic fever can also be caused by chikungunya virus.
However, the type of clinical presentation and other epidemiological and entomological parameters may help in presumptive diagnosis.
If a clustering of acute fever cases have been reported and dengue fever is suspected on clinical grounds and entomological investigations, a reported case of haemorrahagic fever from the area will clinch diagnosis.
If any case of encephalopathy due to unknown aetiology occurs in an area not known for JE, it should be reported immediately to the state health authorities for appropriate investigations.
If cases of severe dehydration or death following acute watery diarrhoea are reported in patients older than 5 years of age, cholera should be suspected and control measures at the field level should be initiated as per guidelines.
If patient present with jaundice, renal involvement and hemorrhage, leptospirosis should be strongly suspected.
If the increase meets the criteria of an outbreak, necessary clinical, epidemiological, laboratory and entomological investigations must be conducted to confirm diagnosis.
In endemic areas cases are, therefore, seen more often in children under 15 years of age as the adult population is already immune through natural infection.
In majority of the cases, individuals develop immunity after infection.
In the absence of ORT, high mortality rates have been recorded.
Increase in the acute fever cases may be due to typhoid fever which is also relatively common in many parts of the country.
Infection control precautions must be practiced while investigating or treating patients, and handling infectious biological material.
Investigation of the case of haemorrahagic fever may identify a dengue fever outbreak.
Isolation of virus from CSF or brain tissue is not routinely done.
It is important that the community and the peripheral health personnel are aware of the danger sign of blood in the stools (bloody diarrhoea) so that medical help is sought immediately.
JE infection is usually mild with no overt clinical symptoms or mild fever with headache.
JE patients will give a history of acute onset with fever and change in behavior or sensorium lasting for more than 24 hours.
Leptospirosis is emerging as an important cause of jaundice in many parts of country.
Malaria is considered as the cause of the outbreak.
Malaria is relatively common in our country.
Meningitis may occur due to tubercular, viral or pyogenic organisms.
Meningitis, pulmonary and cardiac involvement may also be present in some cases.
Once pneumonia is suspected, the specific etiologic diagnosis is necessary for proper management to prevent mortality and reduce further transmission.
One of the complications of malaria caused by P.falciparum is encephalopathy.
Outbreaks of dysentery can occur in children. Such outbreaks have the potential of causing a large number of deaths unless specific treatment is initiated in a timely manner.
Patient develops nonspecific symptoms including malaise, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fever, and mild pain in abdomen.
Patient should be hospitalized immediately to reduce mortality rates.
Patients should be examined to see if the clinical presentation is compatible with the case definition of typhoid fever.
Patients with acute pneumonia usually present with acute fever, chills, cough, chest pain, other non specific symptoms, varying degree of respiratory insufficiency, and infiltrate on chest X-ray.
Poliovirus infection is the most important cause of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in children.
Presence of nuchal rigidity and positive Kerning and Brudzinski signs confirm the clinical diagnosis.
Prompt action is important to check the spread of the outbreak and to provide oral rehydration therapy which is life saving.
Recently, outbreaks of hepatitis B occurred in defined rural communities of Gujarat, Haryana and Rajasthan states which were epidemiologically linked to the use of unsafe injections by unqualified medical practitioners.
Secondary household cases during the outbreaks are uncommon.
Severe forms of haemorrahagic fever with high case fatality rates due to yellow fever and ebola fever have been reported from some countries.
Since malaria is relatively common, the diagnosis of malaria should be first considered.
Since samples for virus isolation need special handling, it is appropriate that specialised institutions such as NICD Delhi and NIV Pune are also involved in the investigations in the early stages.
Since typhoid fever is very common in our country, it should always be excluded by careful history, physical examination and blood culture for S.typhi.
Some diseases like plague, anthrax, leptospirosis, influenza, melioidosis and hanta virus infection may result in severe outbreaks with mainly pulmonary involvement.
Some of the diseases such as dengue fever may present in severe form such as haemorrahagic fever and shock syndrome.
Specific types of viral hepatitis in individual patients can't be distinguished on clinical grounds.
State and national authorities must be notified immediately by the fastest routes of communication.
Such complications occur in a relatively small proportion of the cases.
Such outbreaks have also been reported following outbreaks of measles.
The case fatality rate may reach up to 20% among those infected during the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.
The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of rising antibodies, or isolation of leptospires from blood during acute illness and from urine after the first week.
The diagnosis is confirmed if field investigations indicate malariogenic conditions, illness is clinically compatible and anti-malaria treatment is effective.
The disease is clinically indistinguishable from dengue fever.
The disease is usually characterized by abrupt onset of high grade fever, myalgia and conjuctivial suffusion.
The duration of jaundice is variable, but usually lasts 1-3 weeks.
The expression of icterus appears to increase with increasing age.
The facilities for making blood slides and examining them should be available at each PHC.
The focal neurological signs may be stationary or progressive.
The outbreaks were marked by high case fatality rates.
The patient may develop difficulty of speech and other neurological deficits like ocular palsies, hemiplegia, tremor and ataxia.
The patient with JE may present with signs of encephalitis.
The possibility of polio should be considered for any case of AFP, even in areas with high OPV coverage levels and a very low incidence of poliomyelitis.
The report of even a single case of haemorrahagic fever from an area which has a reported increase of acute fever cases compatible with dengue fever as well as a high density of Aedes aegypti is a strong indication in favour of dengue fever.
The type of virus can be identified only by laboratory tests.
The younger the age group, the more susceptible they are to dehydration.
These outbreaks are invariably linked to contamination of water supply.
They can be caused by a variety of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites.
Travel history or close contact with those who have recently traveled abroad should be obtained if the above infections are suspected.
Tuberculous meningitis is relatively common in many parts of our country.
Typhoid fever is usually characterized by gradual onset of malaise, lethargy, headache, and myalgia, loss of appetite and fever that increases in stepwise fashion to reach 39-41 ° C in 5-7 days period.
Unless treated promptly with antibiotics, it is marked by high case fatality rates.
Usually not more than a few such cases (1-2) of JE occur in one village.
Water borne and food borne diseases can present with a variety of clinical symptoms.
While diarrhoeal episodes may also occur in adults, these usually do not result in severe dehydration or death.
208 were found positive for malarial parasite (P.falciparum 36, P.vivax 172).
2294 blood slides were collected in village Banyani upto 2.11.91. 325 were found positive for malarial parasite (P.falciparum 131, P.vivax 194).

Acute paralytic poliomyelitis is characterized by fever followed by abrupt onset of weakness or paralysis of limbs which does not progress after first 3 days.
Adequate staff members who are qualified and/or oriented/trained for undertaking disease surveillance work.
All except malnutrition are communicable diseases directly related to environmental health conditions, and even malnutrition is greatly exacerbated by communicable disease.
All reports of outbreaks of typhoid fever, salmonellosis, shigellosis, acute diarrhoea, viral hepatitis A, tularaemia, invasive meningococcal disease, toxoplasmosis, leptospirosis and Lyme disease were evaluated.
All the residents had access to and used only sanitary latrine.
Almost all the outbreaks of viral hepatitis in India are due to faeco-orally transmitted hepatitis E.
An occasional outbreak may be due to hepatitis A.
Analysis of the data on clinical features in the admitted patients revealed that they initially presented with fever (100%), headache (74%), pain abdomen (18%), vomiting (17%), diarrhoea (15%), constipation (7%), palpable spleen (57%) and palpable liver (13%).
Besides waterborne and vector-borne disease, there may also be major epidemics of highly contagious diseases—those spread by personal contact.
Between 6 and 10% of the refugee population died during the month after arrival in Zaire.
Bidi rolling provided the clue to the genesis of the outbreak in the village Banyani.
Both natural disasters and armed conflict may result in the breakage of water mains or the interruption of electricity supplies required to pump water.
By the third week of the refugee influx, relief efforts began to have a significant impact.
Camps established to provide food relief during famine are a special case, as large numbers of people who are already weak and possibly ill are likely to remain in such camps for a long time.
Cramps, tingling sensation, and hypo-anesthesia of palms and soles are usually present in GBS.
Disaster-affected people are particularly vulnerable to communicable diseases when the disaster and its immediate consequences reduce resistance to disease because of malnutrition, stress, fatigue, etc. and when post-disaster living conditions are unsanitary.
District authorities were informed about the outbreak and a treatment centre was established at village Banyani to treat the patients.
During the emergency phase of a relief operation, death rates should be expressed as deaths/10 000 per day to allow for the detection of sudden changes.
During the period from 18 May to 19 June, 1991, 392 cases of clinically suspected typhoid fever were treated at the outpatient department of PHC Galore, district Hamirpur, Himachal Pradesh.
During the same period, 2184 slides were collected from other villages of PHC within 5 kilometer of village Banyani.
During the survey undertaken on 8.10.1991, 466 blood slides were collected from fever cases.
Earthquakes can trigger landslides that block rivers, causing flooding.
Eastern areas of the Czech Republic were severely flooded in the summer of 1997.
Exceptions are the epidemics occurring in chronic emergencies triggered by drought and civil strife, such as those that occurred in Africa in the 1980s and 1990s.
Fever is usually absent in GBS and the paralysis is symmetrical and distal.
For instance, in the Andes it is not uncommon for a volcanic eruption to melt ice and snow, creating floods, mud flows and rock falls.
Functioning disease surveillance systems and intact environmental health services are crucial in protecting public health and in responding to these outbreaks when they occur in times of disaster.
He also informed the medical officer about a large number of cases having similar illness in the village, of whom many had died.
High winds, coastal storms, mud slides and even earthquakes can all result in standing water, especially where a “cascade” of physical effects occurs.
In all cases, excess standing water can promote the breeding of insect disease vectors, or contaminate water supplies with waste or sewage.
In eastern Zaire in July 1994, the CMR among one million Rwandan refugees ranged from 34.1 to 54.5/10 000 per day, among the highest ever recorded.
In general, health workers should be concerned when crude mortality rates (CMRs) in a displaced population exceed 1/10 000 per day, or when under-five mortality rates exceed 2/10000 per day.
Isolation of wild poliovirus from AFP cases or contacts confirms the diagnosis of acute poliomyelitis.
It is noteworthy that District Farukhabad did not report any case of falciparum malaria in the last 3 years.
Koraput district was reported to be affected by an "outbreak" of acute gastroenteritis (GE) in July-August, 1991. About 2270 cases and 413 deaths occurred during this period.
Laboratory should have access to electronic communication network for rapid transmission of results and/or early warning signals.
Laboratory should have adequate inventory/or access to basic material that may be needed for surveillance and investigation of outbreak or to provide support in times of disasters.
Laboratory should have the facilities to wash and sterilize glassware etc. needed for collection and transportation of clinical and environmental specimens as well as for separating serum from blood samples.
Many cases of polio have initially been diagnosed as GBS even by experts. Accordingly, WHO recommends that stool specimens should be tested for poliovirus on all cases of GBS less than 5 years of age.
Many outbreaks are on record where a varying number of cases of jaundice (a few cases to many thousands) occurred in a short period.
More than 200000 people were left without electricity and 30 000 without gas.
Most of the cases had only diarrhoea and vomiting.
NICD team visited the affected area during 1-3 November 1991.
No viral hepatitis A was reported from the populations vaccinated.
None of patients of village Banyani had signs of meningitis.
On inquiry, it was found that bidi rolling and agriculture were the main occupations in village Banyani and a few surrounding villages.
Other hazards may lead standing water or pollute, or interrupt drinking-water supplies.
Outbreaks have been invariably linked to contaminated water supply.
Paralysis is not present at birth and is not associated with serious injury or mental retardation.
Paralytic poliomyelitis is most often confused with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), transverse myelitis, and traumatic paralysis due to sciatic nerve injury.
Postdisaster analysis showed that leptospirosis had increased threefold, but that there had been no demonstrable flooding effects in the other diseases targeted.
Recently, a few outbreaks of hepatitis B epidemiologically linked to unsafe injections have also been reported.
Recommended follow-up measures included monitoring and controlling rodents.
Residents of a locality in North West Delhi (SD Block, Pitampura : population 1435) felt an unusual increase in the cases of jaundice in April, 1994.
Routine measures, such as measles immunization, vitamin A supplements, standard disease treatment protocols and community outreach programmes, were established in each camp, and the water-distribution system began to provide an average of 5–10 liters per person per day.
Salmonella typhi was isolated in 10 of 25 blood samples examined in the laboratories of Medical College, Shimla.
Sewer pipes and sewage treatment works may also be broken or rendered inoperable.
Standard operating procedural manual should be available with the laboratory.
Sufficient stationery for maintaining the records and dispatching the same to other centers.
Thanks to effective environmental health measures, epidemics following disasters are no longer common.
The attack rate of jaundice was found to be 1.9 percent.
The Block had piped water supply and there was no other source of water.
The block was inhabited by people belonging to middle or upper socio-economic strata.
The Centre of Microbiology of the Czech National Institute of Public Health took immediate action, in collaboration with the regional hygiene stations.
The conditions leading to an epidemic are caused mostly by secondary effects and not by the primary hazard, except in the case of flooding, which can cause an increase in waterborne and vector-borne diseases.
The control of communicable diseases depends on a healthy environment (clean water, adequate sanitation, vector control, shelter), immunization, and health workers trained in early diagnosis and treatment.
The diagnosis of paralytic poliomyelitis should be discarded only after another diagnosis has been established.
The epidemics of communicable diseases that have swept refugee camps in Africa and other parts of the world.
The five most common causes of death in emergencies and disasters are diarrhoea, acute respiratory infection, measles, malnutrition and, in endemic zones, malaria.
The length of time that people spend in temporary settlements is an important determinant of the risk of disease transmission.
The list provided information on name, age, sex, address and date of onset of symptoms for all the 101 cases.
The message stated that a large number of fever cases and 21 deaths had occurred in a village in district Farukhabad.
The outbreak in SD Block was due to hepatitis E.
The PHC considered it an outbreak of falciparum malaria.
The prolonged mass settlement of refugees in temporary shelters with only minimal provision for essential personal hygiene is typical of a situation that may cause epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases.
The residents therefore, used on-line-booster pumps to lift the water to their overhead tanks.
The state health authorities informed the National Institute of Communicable Diseases on 1.11.91 about the outbreak.
The water supply was intermittent and did not fulfill the requirements of people.
There are global hypotonia and global absence of deep tendon reflexes.
They examined 756 Persons, 696 (92%) of them were presently suffering from fever usually accompanied with rigors and chills.
This high mortality rate was almost entirely due to an epidemic of diarrhea diseases and inadequate water supply.
Traumatic paralysis due to sciatic nerve injury following a misplaced gluteal injection can be differentiated by a careful history and physical examination.
Typical findings on physical examination include: acute flaccid paralysis, muscle tenderness, no sensory loss, absent or depressed deep tendon reflexes, and asymmetrical findings.
Wasting of affected muscle is a late finding. Residual paralysis after 60 days of onset of symptoms, or death or unknown follow-up in an AFP case makes the presumptive diagnosis.
While going through the streets in village Banyani, it was observed that a large number of residents were rolling bidies (local cigarette) in front of their houses.
You found that most of the cases were due to hepatitis E (laboratory findings).
You suspect contaminated piped water as the major factor in this outbreak.
A case of cholera should be suspected when, in an area where the disease is not known to be present, a patient aged 5 years or more develops severe dehydration or dies from acute watery diarrhoea;
About 80% of those deaths will occur in low to middle-income countries, to which the epidemic is now shifting, largely because of the tobacco industry's global strategy to target young people and adults in those areas.
Active surveillance of population movements can provide data for planning emergency interventions and for general disease surveillance.
Acute respiratory infections and diarrhoea are most often the major killers in emergency situations.
Additionally, the report notes that more than half of the world's population lives in countries with little or no information about the scope of the tobacco pandemic in their country.
Although cholera can be treated, it cannot be controlled by vaccinations or by mass Chemotherapy.
Although most cases of cholera are mild and treatable with simple measures, the disease can rapidly progress and result in death from dehydration.
An emergency treatment facility should be established.
Apart from patients, people visiting the facility should be limited to those giving care.
Appoint someone to treat each collected bucket of water with sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite.
Carry out precautionary measures to reduce contamination of food sold in markets.
Cholera can also spread easily where there is rudimentary sanitation and crowding, as in a refugee camp.
Cholera can spread very quickly in overcrowded living areas.
Cholera is used as an example because the disease remains endemic in many parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Cholera’s prevention and control in emergencies provide examples of general approaches to be adopted with other epidemics.
Compounding the international health epidemic of TB, a new strain --extensive multidrug-resistant tuberculosis -- has recently been documented in 45 nations around the world.
Each year, more than a million-and-a-half people die from the disease.
Early detection and treatment are proven to be the most effective weapons in fighting TB, but there is a critical shortage of technical, financial and human resources to do the basics.
Early vaccination campaigns should be considered before any cases appear.
Enforcing bans on tobacco advertising and promotion; and Raising taxes and prices.
Existing reporting systems can be extended to create an area-wide surveillance system that covers priority diseases, including serious water- and sanitation-related epidemic diseases.
For further information on clinical treatment of cholera see: World Health Organization (1993b).
Gatherings of people should be restricted if an outbreak occurs.
Good record keeping (number of cases and deaths) at clinics and treatment centres will help in assessing whether the epidemic is getting worse, or whether public-health measures are having a positive effect.
Health workers should regularly visit households to detect cases.
Healthy” cholera carriers (i.e. people carrying Vibrio cholerae with no manifest disease) are now common in the general population of many developing countries.
Histories should be taken from these patients, contacts identified, and the source of the disease isolated.
Ideally all measures of cholera avoid should done at every well when the water is collected.
In addition to the WHO, WLF's partners include the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, the Stop TB Partnership, and the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.
In an area where there is an outbreak of cholera, any patient aged 5 years or more develops acute watery diarrhoea, with or without vomiting (World Health Organization, 1993b).
In areas where an outbreak of cholera is possible, supplies and equipment for outbreak control and treatment should be stored locally to deal with the first stages of an outbreak.
In light of these alarming statistics, the center has taken innovative steps to combat the disease.
In the early 1990s, cholera epidemics affected millions of people in Africa and Latin America.
It is important to designate specific health staff for public-health surveillance.
It is therefore important to plan ahead in order to prevent cholera by the proper management of the water supply, sanitation and food hygiene in camps.
It will implement an automated drug inventory system, new to the Philippines, but implemented in other nations -- that will ensure a reliable supply of fresh medications and reduce the costs of managing, storing, and distributing vital TB medicines, making health care more effective and economic.
Its MPOWER package of six strategies is a road map with guideposts helping every country in the world to act before the tobacco scourge needlessly claims millions more lives
Mass immunization is a priority in emergency situations, where people are displaced, there is disruption of normal services, there are crowded or insanitary conditions and/or where there is widespread malnutrition, regardless of whether a single case of measles has been reported or not.
Measles outbreaks are a common hazard in emergencies, often with a high case fatality rate.
Monitoring the epidemic and prevention policies.
Neighbourhood and community health workers, as well as the personnel of temporary relief centres and hospitals, should be alert to patients presenting with any of a list of diseases, including typhoid or paratyphoid fever, cholera, typhus, plague, encephalitis or meningitis, as well as to excessive numbers of poisonings (including food poisoning) or cases of malaria.
No country in the world has fully implemented all five policies at the highest level and with full enforcement.
One confirmed case of cholera should prompt all diarrhea cases to be treated as cholera.
Paralysis is not present at birth and is not associated with serious injury or mental retardation.
Patients suspected of suffering from cholera should be treated in a place set aside for this purpose.
Plans should also be made for the necessary steps to be taken if cholera does break out.
Preparedness measures taken before a disaster can greatly increase the ability to control communicable diseases and prevent epidemics.
Protecting people from secondhand smoke.
Public-health surveillance is the collection, analysis and dissemination of health information to enable appropriate action to be taken.
Send stool samples for laboratory testing, if possible, to confirm the presence of cholera.
Sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite should be added to water at the following chlorine concentrations: 0.05% (0.5 g per litre) for washing; 0.2% (2 g per litre) for cleaning walls and floors; 1% (10 g per litre) for disinfecting contaminated bedding and clothes, and for cleaning latrines.
Steps taken in advance to reduce poverty, increase the level of awareness and organization, and extend normal health and sanitary services will provide additional protection for the community if disaster strikes.
Stored drinking-water should be purified with at least 0.2mg per litre of free residual chlorine.
Such problems are more likely to occur where predisaster conditions, such as those in many densely populated mega-cities, are unsanitary.
Surveillance of public-health problems may be possible to some extent even under the worst conditions of large-scale population movement.
Suspected disease outbreaks, indicated by information from a health surveillance system, should be rapidly investigated using standards protocols for assessment (Médecins Sans Frontières, 1997a; World Health Organization, 1999b).
TB is the 6th leading cause of illness and the 6th leading cause of deaths among Filipinos.
Test indicates faecal pollution and the possible presence of bacteria that cause diarrhoea.
Test samples of water for the presence of Escherichia coli.
The assessment should enable decisions to be taken on how to control the outbreak.
The control of communicable diseases in emergencies, see: Benenson (1995), Perrin (1996), Médecins Sans Frontières (1997a), Sphere Project (2000).
The most effective approach is usually to extend the routes and patterns of reporting used by existing administrative structures in the areas where people are arriving.
The need for early referral of patients with diarrhoea, and preventive measures they can take.
The new center will host a TB Treatment Center, a TB laboratory, and a new Training Center in MDR-TB, one of the most dangerous and fastest growing forms of the disease.
The new training curriculum will begin for clinicians in May, 2008.
The opening of the International Tuberculosis Center for Asia was made possible by support from World Lung Foundation; Ayala Corporation; the Angelo King Foundation; Mrs. Antoinette Magallanes-Fu; Pablo R. Antonio Designs and Consultancy, Inc; Unilever; Metrostonerich; and Argus Construction.
The population should be made aware of the risk of an outbreak.
The report found that only about 5% of the world's population is protected by any one of the leading five tobacco control policies: taxation, ad bans, public education, smoke-free places, and access to cessation support.
The role of hygiene education in these control measures of cholera is critical.
The role of outreach workers in these three activities is important.
The state-of-the-art facility will provide treatment, research, training and a steady supply of much-needed medications in the Philippines and across Asia.
The Tropical Disease Foundation in Partnership with the World Lung Foundation And Other Funding Partners Celebrate Opening Of Facility in Manila.
The two main strategies for controlling outbreaks of communicable disease are to reduce the number of cases through preventive activities and to reduce mortality due to the disease through early case detection and effective treatment.
The WHO report noted that the current five million tobacco-related deaths every year will climb to eight million a year unless governments take strong action.
The WHO report offers an achievable agenda of proven ways to counter the tobacco epidemic, said Louis James de Viel Castel, WLF chairman.
The WHO report outlines a six strategy program, MPOWER, to reduce a global death toll that could reach one billion this century
The WHO report was released today at a press conference in New York.
The WHO report, funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies, is the world's first-ever comprehensive report of how people in 179 countries use tobacco and what their governments are doing to reduce the health effects of tobacco use.
The World Lung Foundation (WLF) applauds the World Health Organization's "WHO Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic 2008" as a landmark step toward helping nations reduce tobacco's deadly toll worldwide.
The World Lung फसं’थान is proud to support the creation of a technologically advanced center devoted to fighting TB in the Philippines and around Asia.
The World Lung Foundation today announced that a grantee, the Tropical Disease Foundation, has opened the first International Tuberculosis Center in Asia to combat Multi-Drug Resistant TB (MDR-TB).
These measures should be put into place rapidly, and should not be delayed while waiting for laboratory confirmation of the disease in question.
These should specify the additional health and environment measures to be taken, as well as how to treat cholera patients.
They key to effective outbreak control is a rapid response, before the outbreak develops into a major epidemic.
This is a critical improvement over the manual system, under which errors in ordering are frequently made, resulting in medicine shortages or inefficient surpluses.
This new system will employ Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Technology, which uses tiny computer chips to automatically identify and track the demand and supply of medicine quickly and accurately.
Those responsible for routine health surveillance should be alert to the possibility of cholera, should be familiar with the signs of the disease and should report suspected cases promptly to the authorities.
To prevent them, hygiene promotion, the provision of adequate quantities of safe water, sanitation facilities and appropriate shelter are absolutely necessary.
Treat wells in the affected area; cover them if possible.
Tuberculosis -- a disease that is both preventable and curable – affects almost nine million people annually around the world.
Tuberculosis: A curable disease that still kills two million people each year.
Untreated, a person with active TB will infect an average of 10 to 15 other people over the course of a 12-month period.
Use patient records to plot outbreaks on a map of the camp.
Warning about the dangers of tobacco.
We believe it will be a place where the tremendously talented people of the Tropical Disease Foundation can advance and share their knowledge for the benefit of patients throughout the region.
WLF was established in response to the global epidemic of lung disease, which kills 10 million people each year.
WLF works in five primary areas: tobacco, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, child lung health, and asthma.
WLF, which develops projects to support organizations and programs that fight lung disease and tobacco use, is an active partner with the Bloomberg Initiative and WHO in producing the report and in many other tobacco control activities.
World lung Foundation applauds world health organization's global tobacco report as a landmark.
World lung Foundation grant results in FIRST Center In Asia to Combat Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis.
A relationship has been proposed between exposures to bacteria and viruses during childhood.
A variety of tests now exist to diagnose allergic conditions; these include testing the skin for responses to known allergens or analyzing the blood for the presence and levels of allergen-specific IgE.
After the chemical mediators of the acute response subside, late phase responses can often occur.
Airways Sneezing, coughing, bronchoconstriction, wheezing and dyspnea, sometimes outright attacks of asthma, in severe cases the airway constricts due to swelling known as angioedema.
Allergic diseases are more common in industrialized countries than in countries that are more traditional or agricultural, and there is a higher rate of allergic disease in urban populations versus rural populations, although these differences are becoming less defined.
Allergic diseases are strongly familial: identical twins are likely to have the same allergic diseases about 70% of the time; the same allergy occurs about 40% of the time in non-identical twins.
Allergic parents are more likely to have allergic children, and their allergies are likely to be stronger than those from non-allergic parents.
Alterations in exposure to microorganisms is the most plausible explanation, at present, for the increase in atopic allergy.
An allergy testing machine being operated in the diagnostic immunology lab at Lackland Air Force Base.
Aside from these ambient allergens, allergic reactions can result from foods, insect stings, and reactions to medications like aspirin, and antibiotics such as penicillin.
Before a diagnosis of allergic disease can be confirmed, the other possible causes of the presenting symptoms should be carefully considered.
But, despite prodigious local and international efforts, only about seven high-burden countries will likely attain these goals.
Certain microbe-sensing proteins, known as Toll-like receptors, found on the surface of cells in the body are also thought to be involved in these processes.
Child Lung Health Project demonstrated that use of standard case management and other training and management techniques developed for tuberculosis control could also be effective with child pneumonia.
Clinical trials have been initiated to test the effectiveness of certain worms in treating some allergies.
Common symptoms of allergy Affected organ Symptom Nose swelling of the nasal mucosa (allergic rhinitis).
Cross-linking of the IgE and Fc receptors occurs when more than one IgE-receptor complex interacts with the same allergenic molecule, and activates the sensitized cell.
Cytokines from mast cells may also play a role in the persistence of long-term effects.
Depending of the rate of severity, it can cause cutaneous reactions, bronchoconstriction, edema, hypotension, coma and even death.
Each year more than three million children die before they reach the age of five from acute respiratory infections such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, HIV-related lung disease, and asthma.
Ears feeling of fullness, possibly pain, and impaired hearing due to the lack of eustachian tube drainage.
Effective drugs to treat and cure the disease have been available for more than 50 years, yet every 15 seconds, someone in the world dies from TB.
Eighty percent of the world's tuberculosis cases are concentrated in 22 "high-burden" developing countries, but no corner of the world is safe.
Endotoxin exposure reduces release of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a, IFN?, interleukin-10, and interleukin-12 from white blood cells (leukocytes) that circulate in the blood.
Ethnicity may play a role in some allergies, however racial factors have been difficult to separate from environmental influences and changes due to migration.
Even more alarming, a person is newly infected with TB every second of every day.
Exposure to allergens, especially in early life, is an important risk factor for allergy.
Exposure to endotoxin and other components of bacteria may reduce atopic diseases.
Eyes redness and itching of the conjunctiva (allergic conjunctivitis).
Food allergies rarely cause respiratory (asthmatic) reactions, or rhinitis.
For instance, allergic rhinitis, also known as hay fever, causes irritation of the nose, sneezing, and itching and redness of the eyes.
Gastrointestinal tract abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, Diarrhea.
Given that 9 of the 22 high-burden countries are in Africa, and that Africa is home to more than 60% of those living with HIV, African health ministers followed suit by declaring TB an emergency in Africa in 2005.
Gutworms and similar parasites are present in untreated drinking water in developing countries, and were present in the water of developed countries until the routine chlorination and purification of drinking water supplies.
Historically, all forms of hypersensitivity were classified as allergies, and all were thought to be caused by an improper activation of the immune system.
Most factors include heredity, sex, race and age, with heredity being by far the most important.
However some allergies are not consistent along genealogies; parents who are allergic to peanuts, may have children who are allergic to ragweed, or siblings that are allergic to different things.
However, the research to support this theory is conflicting, with some studies performed in China and Ethiopia showing an increase in allergy in people infected with intestinal worms.
If later exposure to the same allergen occurs, the allergen can bind to the IgE molecules held on the surface of the mast cells or basophils.
Implementation of this Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015 will save 14 million lives in the next decade.
In 1963, a new classification scheme was designed by Philip Gell and Robin Coombs that described four types of hypersensitivity reactions, known as Type I to Type IV hypersensitivity.
In fact, the most recent data shows that globally, only 53% of new infectious cases are detected.
In Malawi, where the initial project took place, pneumonia deaths in children under five were reduced from 20-25% to 10.3% of all cases.
In particular, research suggests that allergies may coincide with the delayed establishment of gut flora in infants.
In these cases, symptoms arise in areas in contact with air, such as eyes, nose and lungs.
Inhaled allergens can also lead to asthmatic symptoms, caused by narrowing of the airways (bronchoconstriction) and increased production of mucus in the lungs, shortness of breath (dyspnea), coughing and wheezing.
Insect stings, antibiotics and certain medicines produce a systemic allergic response that is also called anaphylaxis; multiple systems can be affected including the digestive system, the respiratory system, and the circulatory system.
Interestingly, it has been suggested that different genetic loci are responsible for asthma, specifically, in people of Caucasian, Hispanic, Asian, and African origins.
International differences have been associated with the number of individuals within a population that suffer from allergy.
It may be that the term 'parasite' could turn out to be inappropriate, and in fact a hitherto unsuspected symbiosis is at work.For more information on this topic, see Helminthic therapy.
It seems that the likelihood of developing allergies is inherited and due to some irregularity in the way the immune system works, but the specific allergen, which causes the development of an allergy, is not.
Late phase responses seen in asthma are slightly different from those seen in other allergic responses, although they are still caused by release of mediators from eosinophils, and are still dependent on activity of TH2 cells.
Later, it became clear that several different disease mechanisms were implicated, with the common link to a disordered activation of the immune system.
Left untreated, a person with active TB will infect an average of 10 to 15 other people every year.
Many allergens are airborne particles, such as dust or pollen.
Many low income countries cannot afford the vaccines or the antibiotics, and efforts are further hindered by inadequate drug distribution.
Mobile populations, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and an alarming increase in multi-drug resistant strains of the disease prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare tuberculosis a global emergency in 1992.
Moreover, there is generally no clear protocols for treatment of childhood pneumonia, so if sick children present in an emergency room, they may not be treated using evidence-based techniques.
Most of these children die from severe pneumonia, which is five times more common in developing countries than in developed countries, with a death rate that is 10 to 50 times higher.
Once a diagnosis of asthma, rhinitis, anaphylaxis, or other allergic disease has been made, there are several methods for discovering the causative agent of that allergy.
One of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals is to reduce the mortality rate of children under five by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015.
Overall, boys have a higher risk of developing allergy than girls,although for some diseases, namely asthma in young adults, females are more likely to be affected.
Pirquet called this phenomenon "allergy" from the Greek words allos meaning "other" and ergon meaning "work".
Pneumonia occurs less and is less deadly in the developed world due in part to vaccination and the availability of cheap and effective antibiotics.
protection against the development of allergy, which has been called – the "hygiene hypothesis".
Rather than being discouraged, the international community has re-invigorated its work to stop TB.
Recent research has shown that some common parasites, such as intestinal worms (e.g. hookworms), secrete chemicals into the gut wall (and hence the bloodstream) that suppress the immune system and prevent the body from attacking the parasite.
Risk factors for allergy can be placed in two general categories, namely host and environmental factors.
Several studies have shown that IgE levels are highest in childhood and fall rapidly between the ages of 10 and 30 years.
Since children that live in large families or overcrowded households, or attend day care, have a reduced incidence of allergic disease.
Skin allergies frequently cause rashes, or swelling and inflammation within the skin, in what is known as a "wheal and flare" reaction characteristic of hives and angioedema.
Substances that come into contact with the skin, such as latex are also common causes of allergic reactions, known as contact dermatitis or eczema.
Symptoms of food allergy include abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, diarrhoea, itchy skin, and swelling of the skin during hives or angiooedema.
The concept "allergy" was originally introduced in 1906 by the Viennese pediatrician Clemens von Pirquet, after noting that some of his patients were hypersensitive to normally innocuous entities such as dust, pollen, or certain foods.
The first is an acute response that occurs immediately after exposure to an allergen.
The Foundation will continue to work with its partners to meet - and to exceed - these targets.
The four main candidate environmental factors are alterations in exposure to infectious diseases during early childhood, environmental pollution, allergen levels, and dietary changes.
The nature of anaphylaxis is such that the reaction can seemingly be subsiding, but may recur throughout a prolonged period of time.
The pathophysiology of allergic responses can be divided into two phases.
The peak prevalence of hay fever is highest in children and young adults and the incidence of asthma is highest in children under 10.
The reaction is usually seen 2-24 hours after the original reaction.
The risk of allergic sensitization and the development of allergies varies with age, with young children most at risk.
The severity of this type of allergic response often requires injections of epinephrine, sometimes through a device known as the Epi-Pen auto-injector.
The work of the World Lung Foundation and its partners focuses on the 22 countries where 80 percent of the world's tuberculosis cases are concentrated.
The World Lung Foundation contributes to international efforts to reach this goal by supporting innovative approaches to improving child lung health, such as the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease’s Child Lung Health Project.
There are recent increases in the incidence of allergic disorders, however, that cannot be explained by genetic factors alone.
This gives rise to a new slant on the hygiene hypothesis theory — that co-evolution of man and parasites has led to an immune system that only functions correctly in the presence of the parasites.
This is due to the migration of other leukocytes such as neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils and macrophages to the initial site.
This phase can either subside or progress into a "late phase reaction" which can substantially prolong the symptoms of a response, and result in tissue damage.
This type of reaction can be triggered suddenly or the onset can be delayed.
Treatments for allergies include allergen avoidance, use of antihistamines, steroids or other oral medications, immunotherapy to desensitize the response to allergen, and targeted therapy.
Two billion people - one third of the world's population - are infected with the bacterium that causes tuberculosis.
Two million people die from tuberculosis each year.
Vasomotor rhinitis, for example, is one of many maladies that shares symptoms with allergic rhinitis, underscoring the need for professional differential diagnosis.
We are working cooperatively with the national tuberculosis control programs in these countries to implement the Global Plan, and to support the innovative community solutions envisioned in the Global Plan.
WHO goals for tuberculosis control were to detect 70% of new infectious TB cases and to cure 85% of them by 2005.
WHO, the STOP TB Partnership, and other national and international agencies have developed an ambitious ten-year plan that will lay the groundwork for the eventual eradication of TB.
With this new classification, the word "allergy" was restricted to only type I hypersensitivities (also called immediate hypersensitivity), which are characterized as rapidly developing reactions.
Without them, the immune system becomes unbalanced and oversensitive.
(Asthma, eczema and allergic rhinitis together) 2.3 million (about 3.7%), prevalence has increased by 48.9% between 2001 and 2005.
(NACO) HIV/AIDS programs in India have focused predominantly on high-risk groups such as migrant laborers, truck drives, sex workers and intravenous drug users.
5-7% of infants and 1-2% of adults. A 117.3% increase in peanut allergies was observed from 2001 to 2005, an estimated 25,700 people in England are affected.
A 2003 Royal College of Physicians report presented a case for improvement of what were felt to be inadequate allergy services in the UK. [65] In 2006, the House of Lords convened a subcommittee that reported in 2007.
A low total IgE level is not adequate to rule out sensitization to commonly inhaled allergens.
A review by the Mayo Clinic in Rochester confirmed the safety and efficacy of allergen immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, allergic forms of asthma, and stinging insect based on numerous well-designed scientific studies.
A second form of immunotherapy involves the intravenous injection of monoclonal anti-IgE antibodies.
A small plastic or metal device is used to puncture or prick the skin.
A third type, Sublingual immunotherapy, is an orally-administered therapy which takes advantage of oral immune tolerance to non-pathogenic antigens such as foods and resident bacteria.
About 220 cases of anaphylaxis and 3 deaths per year are due to latex allergy.
About 400 deaths due to penicillin anaphylaxis.
Additionally, HIV prevalence is moving from the urban centers to the rural populations: rural 58.6%, urban 41.4%, with a population split of 72.2% rural, 27.8% urban including in groups that are most affected.
Additionally, national and international guidelines confirm the clinical efficacy of injection immunotherapy in rhinitis and asthma, as well as the safety, provided that recommendations are followed.
After completing medical school and graduating with a medical degree, a physician will then undergo three years of training in internal medicine (to become an internist) or pediatrics (to become a pediatrician).
After obtaining postgraduate exams (MRCP or MRCPCH respectively) a doctor works as several years as a specialist registrar before qualifying for the General Medical Council specialist register.
Allergist-immunologists who are listed as ABAI-certified have successfully passed the certifying examination of the American Board of Allergy and Immunology (ABAI), following their fellowship.
Allergy services may also be delivered by immunologists.
Although genetic factors fundamentally govern susceptibility to atopic disease, increases in atopy have occurred within too short a time frame to be explained by a genetic change in the population.
An allergist-immunologist is a physician specially trained to manage and treat asthma and the other allergic diseases.
An estimated 150 people die annually from anaphylaxis due to food allergy.
An experimental treatment, enzyme potentiated desensitization (EPD), has been tried for decades but is not generally accepted as effective.
Anaphylaxis At least 40 deaths per year due to insect venom.
Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra (especially Mumbai), Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Tamil Nadu, with 45 districts have a particularly high prevalence of HIV/AIDS.
Asthma 10 million suffers from allergic asthma (about 3% of the population).
Asthma prevalence is 39% higher in African Americans than in whites. 5.7 million (about 9.4%).
Becoming an allergist-immunologist requires completion of at least nine years of training.
Between 1960 and 1990 prevalence has increased from 3% to 10% in children.
Between 1999 and 2006, 48 deaths occurred in people ranging from five months to 85 years old.
Changes in rates and types of infection alone however, have been unable to explain the observed increase in allergic disease, and recent evidence has focused attention on the importance of the gastrointestinal microbial environment.
Common areas for testing include the inside forearm and the back.
Desensitization or hyposensitization is a treatment in which the patient is gradually vaccinated with progressively larger doses of the allergen in question.
Drug allergies Anaphylactic reactions to penicillin cause 400 deaths.
Drugs help to alleviate the symptoms of allergy, and are imperative in the recovery of acute anaphylaxis, but play little role in chronic treatment of allergic disorders.
EPD has also been tried for the treatment of autoimmune diseases but again is not FDA approved or of proven effectiveness.
EPD uses dilutions of allergen and an enzyme, beta-glucuronidase, to which T-regulatory lymphocytes are supposed to respond by favouring desensitization, or down-regulation, rather than sensitization.
Food allergies 2-4% of children and 1-2% of adults.
For assessing the presence of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, allergy skin testing is preferred over blood allergy tests because it is more sensitive and specific, simpler to use, and less expensive.
For instance, people with cat allergies were encouraged to avoid them.
HIV has spread to each and every Indian State and territory.
However, of the 40 percent HIV infections among women, only 0.5% sex workers.
If a serious life threatening anaphylactic reaction has brought a patient in for evaluation, some allergists will prefer an initial blood test prior to performing the skin prick test.
If the patient is allergic to the substance, then a visible inflammatory reaction will usually occur within 30 minutes.
Important elements of newer hygiene hypotheses also include exposure to endotoxins, exposure to pets and growing up on a farm.
In a sense, the person builds up immunity to increasing amounts of the allergen in question.
In alternative medicine, a number of allergy treatments are described by its practitioners, particularly naturopathic, herbal medicine, homeopathy, traditional Chinese medicine and kinesiology.
In other states such as Goa and Gujarat the epidemic is concentrated in a few districts.
In six and seven year olds asthma increased from 18.4% to 20.9% over five years, during the same time the rate decreased from 31% to 24.7% in 13 to 14 year olds.
In the United States physicians who hold certification by the American Board of Allergy and Immunology (ABAI) have successfully completed an accredited educational program.
In the United States, sublingual immunotherapy is gaining support among traditional allergists and is endorsed by doctors who treat allergy.
Increasingly, allergists are measuring and recording the diameter of the wheal and flare reaction.
Initially the focus was on screening foreigners, especially foreign students. Gradually, the focus moved on to screening blood banks. By early 1987, efforts were made up to set up a national network of HIV screening centers in major urban areas.
Insect venom Around 15% of adults have mild, localized allergic reactions.
Internists or pediatricians who wish to focus on the sub-specialty of allergy-immunology then complete at least an additional two years of study, called a fellowship, in an allergy-immunology training program.
Interpretation by well-trained allergists is often guided by relevant literature.
Interpretation of the results of the skin prick test is normally done by allergists on a scale of severity, with +/- meaning borderline reactivity, and 4+ being a large reaction.
It concluded likewise that allergy services were insufficient to deal with what the Lords referred to as an "allergy epidemic" and its social cost; it made several other recommendations.
It is speculated that these infections exert their effect by critically altering TH1/TH2 regulation.
It is thought that reduced bacterial and viral infections early in life direct the maturing immune system away from TH1 type responses, leading to unrestrained TH2 responses that allow for an increase in allergy.
It relies on the progressive skewing of IgG antibody production, to block excessive IgE production seen in atopys.
Many diseases related to inflammation such as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and allergic diseases—hay fever and asthma—have increased in the Western world over the past 2-3 decades.
Meta-analyses have also confirmed efficacy of the treatment in allergic rhinitis in children and in asthma.
In the United Kingdom, allergy is a subspecialty of general medicine or pediatrics.
Once physicians have finished training in one of these specialties, they must pass the exam of either the American Board of Pediatrics (ABP) or the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM).
One such method has a sensitivity of about 70.8% and a positive predictive value of 72.6% according to a large study.
Other newer methods use colorimetric or fluorometric technology in the place of radioactive isotopes.
Peanut and/or tree nut (e.g. walnut, almond and cashew) allergy affects about three million Americans, or 1.1% of the population.
Radiometric assays include the radioallergosorbent test (RAST) test method, which uses IgE-binding (anti-IgE) antibodies labeled with radioactive isotopes for quantifying the levels of IgE antibody in the blood.
Several antagonistic drugs are used to block the action of allergic mediators, or to prevent activation of cells and degranulation processes.
Skin testing is also known as "puncture testing" and "prick testing" due to the series of tiny puncture or pricks made into the patient's skin.
Skin tests may not be an option if the patient has widespread skin disease or has not avoided antihistamines for several days.
Small amounts of suspected allergens and/or their extracts (pollen, grass, mite proteins, peanut extract, etc.) are introduced to sites on the skin marked with pen or dye (the ink/dye should be carefully selected, lest it cause an allergic response itself).
Some "screening" test methods are intended to provide qualitative test results, giving a "yes" or "no" answer in patients with suspected allergic sensitization.
Some patients may believe they have determined their own allergic sensitivity from observation, but a skin test has been shown to be much better than patient observation to detect allergy.
Sometimes, the allergens are injected "intradermally" into the patient's skin, with a needle and syringe.
Statistical methods, such as ROC curves, predictive value calculations, and likelihood ratios have been used to examine the relationship of various testing methods to each other.
Strict avoidance still has a role in management though, and is often used in managing food allergies.
Studies have demonstrated the long-term efficacy and the preventive effect of immunotherapy in reducing the development of new allergy.

These bind to free and B-cell associated IgE; signalling their destruction.
These include antihistamines, cortisone, dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, epinephrine (adrenaline), theophylline and cromolyn sodium.
These methods have shown that patients with a high total IgE have a high probability of allergic sensitization, but further investigation with specific allergy tests for a carefully chosen allergens is often warranted.
They do not bind to IgE already bound to the Fc receptor on basophils and mast cells, as this would stimulate the allergic inflammatory response.
This article or section deals primarily with the United States and does not represent a worldwide view of the subject.
This can be determined through the use of radiometric and colormetric immunoassays.
This can either reduce the severity or eliminate hypersensitivity altogether.
This kind of testing measures a "total IgE level" - an estimate of IgE contained within the patient's serum.
This response will range from slight reddening of the skin to a full-blown hive (called "wheal and flare") in more sensitive patients.
This therapy currently accounts for 40 percent of allergy treatment in Europe.
Traditionally treatment and management of allergies involved simply avoiding the allergen in question or otherwise reducing exposure.
Various blood allergy testing methods are also available for detecting allergy to specific substances.
While avoidance may help to reduce symptoms and avoid life-threatening anaphylaxis, it is difficult to achieve for those with pollen or similar air-borne allergies.
While this form of immunotherapy is very effective in treating several types of atopy, it should not be used in treating the majority of people with food allergies.

Acute myelogenous leukemia Occurs more commonly in adults than in children, and more commonly in men than women.
Advancements in microscopy were essential to the early study of infectious diseases.
Aleukemia can occur in any of the four major types of leukemia, and is particularly common in hairy cell leukemia.
Alexander Fleming discovered the world's first antibiotic Penicillin.

B-cell ALL usually is not cured by standard ALL therapy.
Because these patients have a worse prognosis than other individuals with ALL, many oncologists recommend allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT), since remission may be brief following conventional ALL chemotherapy.
Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is uncommon, although the disease can occasionally cause cranial nerve palsies.
Chronic leukemia is distinguished by the excessive build up of relatively mature, but still abnormal, blood cells.
Chronic leukemia mostly occurs in older people, but can theoretically occur in any age group.

Damage to the bone marrow, by way of displacing the normal bone marrow cells with higher numbers of immature white blood cells, results in a lack of blood platelets, which are important in the blood clotting process.
Edward Jenner, Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin developed effective vaccines for smallpox and polio, which would later result in the eradication and near-eradication of these diseases, respectively.
Even when the causes become known, they may not be readily controllable, such as naturally occurring background radiation, and therefore not especially helpful for prevention purposes.
Fanconi anemia is also a risk factor for developing acute myelogenous leukemia.
Finally, the red blood cell deficiency leads to anemia, which may cause dyspnea.
For adult ALL, standard induction plans include prednisone, vincristine, and an anthracycline drug; other drug plans may include L-asparaginase or cyclophosphamide.
For an aleukemic patient, the white blood cell counts in the bloodstream can be normal or low.
For children with low-risk ALL, standard therapy usually consists of three drugs (prednisone, L-asparaginase, and vincristine) for the first month of treatment.
For example, an "uncomplicated" pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist (lung physician).
Frequently, these extra white blood cells are immature or dysfunctional.
Furthermore, the diseases are classified into lymphoblastic or lymphocytic leukemias, which indicate that the cancerous change took place in a type of marrow cell that normally goes on to form lymphocytes.
Generally, infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists.
Gerhard Domagk develops Sulphonamides, the first broad spectrum synthetic antibacterial drugs.
German postage stamps depicting four antique microscopes.
Hairy cell leukemia About 80% of affected people are adult men.
High-risk children may receive these drugs plus an anthracycline such as daunorubicin.
High-risk patients receive higher drug doses plus treatment with extra chemotherapeutic agents.
However, the leukemic cells are staying in the marrow instead of entering the bloodstream, where they would be visible in a blood test.
Immediate treatment is required in acute leukemias due to the rapid progression and accumulation of the malignant cells, which then spill over into the bloodstream and spread to other organs of the body.
In children, an intensive 6-month treatment program is needed after induction, followed by 2 years of maintenance chemotherapy.
In fact, leukemia is a more common cause of death for children in the US than any other type of malignant disease.
Induction chemotherapy to bring about remission - that is, leukemic cells are no longer found in bone marrow samples.
Instead, higher response rates are achieved with the aggressive, cyclophosphamide-based regimens that are used for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Leukemia is a broad term covering a spectrum of diseases.
Leukemia is clinically and pathologically split into its acute and chronic forms.
Leukemia is part of the broad group of diseases called hematological neoplasms.
Leukemia or leukaemia is a cancer of the blood or bone marrow and is characterized by an abnormal proliferation (production by multiplication) of blood cells, usually white blood cells (leukocytes).
Leukemia, like other cancers, results from somatic mutations in the DNA which activate oncogenes or deactivate tumor suppressor genes, and disrupt the regulation of cell death, differentiation or division.
Leukemias disease also affects adults, especially those age 65 and older.
Leukemias sometimes occur in younger adults, but it almost never affects children.
Louis Pasteur proved beyond doubt that certain diseases are caused by infectious agents, and developed a vaccine for rabies.
Myeloid or myelogenous leukemias, which indicate that the cancerous change took place in a type of marrow cell that normally goes on to form red cells, some types of white cells, and platelets.
No reported cases in young children, 96% to 100% at ten years Incurable, but easily treatable.
Only children with T-cell leukemia, a high white blood cell count, or leukemia cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) need to receive cranial irradiation as well as IT therapy.
or example, certain cases of ALL are associated with viral infections by either the human immunodeficiency virus or human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1 and -2, causing adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma).
Patients with low- to average-risk ALL receive therapy with antimetabolite drugs such as methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP).
PCR testing is especially important for patients whose disease is B-cell in type.
People who receive bone marrow transplantation will require protective isolation in the hospital, including filtered air, sterile food, and sterilization of the microorganisms in the gut, until their total white blood cell (WBC) count is above 500.
Proper management of Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) focuses on control of bone marrow and systemic (whole-body) disease as well as prevention of cancer at other sites, particularly the central nervous system (CNS).
Researchers have strong suspicions about four possible causes: natural or artificial ionizing radiation, certain kinds of chemicals, some viruses genetic predispositions
Robert Koch, provided the study of infectious diseases with a scientific basis known as Koch's postulates.
Ships and other cargo carriers often harbor unintended "passengers” that can spread diseases to faraway destinations.
Some leukemia patients do not have high white blood cell counts visible during a regular blood count.
Such abnormalities have a large impact upon prognosis and, consequently, treatment plans.
Such ideas became more popular in Europe during the renaissance, particularly through the writing of the Italian monk Girolamo Fracastoro.
The bone marrow still contains cancerous white blood cells which disrupt the normal production of blood cells.
The different leukemias likely have different causes, and very little is certain about what causes them.
The disease has not been definitively diagnosed after an initial workup.
The disease has not responded to first line antibiotics.
The disease might be dangerous to other patients, and the patient might have to be isolated.
The excessive number of cells can also interfere with the level of other cells, causing a harmful imbalance in the blood count.
The high number of white blood cells are apparent when a blood sample is viewed under a microscope.
The infectious agent is of an uncommon nature (e.g. tropical diseases).
The medical treatment of infectious diseases falls into the medical field of Infectiology and in some cases the study of propagation pertains to the field of Epidemiology.
The patient is immunocompromised (for example, in AIDS or after chemotherapy).
The rapid growth of cities in many developing countries tends to concentrate large numbers of people into crowded areas with poor sanitation.
The word leukemia, which means 'white blood', is derived from the disease's namesake high white blood cell counts that most leukemia patients have before treatment.
The work of the infectiologist therefore entails working with both patients and general practitioners, as well as laboratory scientists, immunologists, bacteriologists and other specialists.
There is no single known cause for all of the different types of leukemia.
These conditions foster transmission of contagious diseases.
These mutations may occur spontaneously or as a of exposure to radiation or carcinogenic substances and are likely to be influenced by genetic factors.
This could cause the patient's immune system to be unable to fight off a simple infection or to start attacking other body cells.
This crowding makes the bone marrow unable to produce healthy blood cells.
This less-common condition is called aleukemia.
This means people with leukemia may become bruised, bleed excessively, or develop pinprick bleeds (petechiae).
Typically taking months to years to progress, the cells are produced at a much higher rate than normal cells, resulting in many abnormal white blood cells in the blood.
Until the cause or causes of leukemia are found, there is no way to prevent the disease.
Viruses have also been linked to some forms of leukemia.
When the Black Death bubonic plague reached al-Andalus in the 14th century, Ibn Khatima and Ibn al-Khatib hypothesized that infectious diseases are caused by "contagious entities" which enter the human body.
Whereas acute leukemia must be treated immediately, chronic forms are sometimes monitored for some time before treatment to ensure maximum effectiveness of therapy.
While with international jet-airplane travel, people infected with a disease can carry it to distant lands, or home to their families, before their first symptoms appear.
About 20% to 30% of patients taking interferon show elimination of the abnormal chromosome and improved survival.
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) is most common for adults; more men than women are affected.
Allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT) is reserved primarily for patients under 55 years of age who have a compatible family donor.
Allogeneic bone marrow transplant is available for about 15% of all patients with AML.
Alternatively, patients with recurrent ALL may benefit from participation in new clinical trials of alloBMT, immune system agents, and chemotherapeutic agents, or low-dose radiotherapy, if the cancer recurs throughout the body or CNS.
Approximately half of newly diagnosed AML patients are in this age group, with 75% achieving a complete remission (CR) after induction and consolidation therapy.
As of 1998, it is estimated that each year, approximately 30,800 individuals will be diagnosed with leukemia in the United States and 21,700 individuals will die of the disease.
At the present time, clinical trials are being conducted using immunologic compounds (e.g., interferons, monoclonal antibodies) as well as new chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., bryostatin, dolastatin 10, and PSC 83 - a cyclosporine drug given with chemotherapy to overcome drug resistance).
Blast cell numbers will be reduced temporarily, but they will increase again within 3 to 6 weeks. Individuals showing lymphoid transformation have a slightly better outlook.
But, fortunately, a large group of CLL patients do not require therapy.
By contrast, maintenance treatment involves drug doses that are lower than those administered during the induction phase.
By contrast, older individuals with CLL-related complications or more advanced disease (Rai Stage III or IV) may benefit from chemotherapy and treatment with a corticosteroid (e.g., prednisone, prednisolone).
Chemotherapeutic drugs such as hydroxyurea (Hydrea) and busulfan (Myleran) can normalize the blood count for a period of time, but they do not increase survival.
Children who have hyperleukocytosis (too many white blood cells), especially monocytic M5 leukemia, have a poor prognosis.
Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is probably incurable by present treatments.
Consolidation or "maintenance" treatments may be given to prevent disease recurrence once remission has been achieved.
Consolidation therapy is complex, but it should include at least two courses of high-dose ara-C (HDAC).
Consolidation treatment often entails a repetition of induction chemotherapy or the intensification chemotherapy with added drugs.
Corticosteroids are first-line agents for people in whom the immune systems has been altered by CLL. CLL may cause autoimmune syndromes in which the patient's immune system attacks and destroys his or her own blood cells.
Elderly AML patients have special treatment concerns.
For example, in older patients (60+ years) who have low-risk early stage disease (Rai Stage 0) a conservative "watch and wait" approach may be taken.
For example, individuals showing myeloid transformation may be given drugs that are used to induce remission in AML - that is, daunorubicin and cytarabine, with or without 6-thioguanine or etoposide.
For patients who do not respond to interferon, autologous or allogeneic stem,   cell transplantation is the only alternative.
For younger patients who are experiencing symptoms, the physician may consider early chemotherapy, plus allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT; autoBMT).
Gleevec, is one of a new class of cancer drugs that disables an abnormal enzyme in the cancerous cell, kills it, but leaves healthy cells virtually untouched.
Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an incurable, indolent blood disorder in which mutated, partly matured B cells accumulate in the bone marrow.
Hairy cell leukemia’s name is derived from the shape of the cells, which look like they are covered with short, fine, hair-shaped projections.
High-dose post-induction chemotherapy is unlikely to be tolerated by elderly patients.
HLA (human leukocyte antigen) typing of all patients under age 60, as well as typing of siblings, parents, and children, if available.
However, one in ten latent infections will progress to TB disease, which, if left untreated, kills more than half of its victims.
Hundreds of clinical trials are being planned or conducted at any given time.
If leukemia has invaded the lymph nodes at many different sites, total body irradiation (TBI) may be needed.
If possible, they should receive re-induction chemotherapy, followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplant (alloBMT).
If the patient experiences blood flow problems caused by high numbers of leukemia cells in the circulation, the physician may recommend leukapheresis, also known as apheresis, to separate out white blood cells, prior to chemotherapy.
In 2004, mortality and morbidity statistics included 14.6 million chronic active TB cases, 8.9 million new cases, and 1.6 million deaths, mostly in developing countries.
In addition, a rising number of people in the developed world are contracting tuberculosis because their immune systems are compromised by immunosuppressive drugs, substance abuse, or HIV/AIDS.
In addition, clinical trials are evaluating the potential benefits of substances such as vaccines, monoclonal antibodies (immunologic substances that can direct the patient's immune system to kill cancer cells), and hormones (e.g., growth factors, interleukins).
In addition, specific treatment plans may be used, depending on the type of leukemia that has been diagnosed.
In children under 3 years of age, the anthracycline used for induction should be chosen with care, since doxorubicin produces more toxicity and related deaths than daunorubicin.
In general, CML treatment options are divided into two groups: those that do not increase survival and those that do.
In general, most oncologists rely on combinations of drugs for the initial, induction phase of chemotherapy.
In June of 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib (Sprycel(tm)) to treat CML that does not respond to other therapy.
In limited cases, the patient may benefit from splenectomy (removal of the spleen).
In most cases, one round of treatment will produce a prolonged remission.
In the short term, especially when neutrophil counts are low, many patients also take antibiotics until their white blood cell counts have recovered to normal levels.
Individuals who are over age 75 or who have significant medical conditions can be treated effectively with low-dose ara-C.
Initial treatment of AML usually begins with induction chemotherapy using a combination of drugs such as daunorubicin (DNR), cytarabine (ara-C), idarubicin, thioguanine, etoposide, or mitoxantrone, anabolic steroids.
Leukapheresis usually takes 3 or 4 hours to complete.
Leukapheresis, also known as a peripheral blood stem cell transplant, with stem cell cryopreservation (frozen storage) prior to any other treatment.
Many different chemotherapeutic plans are available for the treatment of AML.
Many induction trials have produced good results using combinations of cytarabine (ara-C) plus an anthracycline (e.g., daunorubicin, doxorubicin).
Most oncologists base CLL treatment upon both the stage and symptoms of the patient.
New drugs that are being studied in clinical trials of CML include homoherringtonine with interferon-alpha (INF-a), paclitaxel (Taxol), QS21 (a plant extract that heightens immune responses), and amifostin (a chemical that lessens some side effects of chemotherapy).
Not everyone infected develops the full-blown disease; asymptomatic, latent TB infection is most common.
Once the patient is in remission, he or she will receive consolidation or maintenance therapy, for example, consolidation therapy with high-dose ara-C (HDAC) with/without anthracycline drugs).
One treatment that does impact on CML survival is allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the use of high dose chemotherapy and radiation followed by infusion of a donor bone marrow.
Other cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, attack healthy cells as well as cancer cells, leaving patients with unpleasant and often severe side effects.
Other mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium canetti, and Mycobacterium microti can also cause tuberculosis, but these species do not usually infect healthy adults.
Other treatments include rituximab infusion or self-injection with Interferon-alpha.
Over one-third of the world's population has been exposed to the TB bacterium, and new infections occur at a rate of one per second.
Overall, the strategy is to control bone marrow and systemic (whole-body) disease while offering specific treatment for the central nervous system (CNS), if involved.Patients of Hairy cell leukemia engage in "watchful waiting" with routine bloodwork and exams every three to six months to monitor disease progression and identify any new symptoms.
Patients who need treatment, which includes most newly diagnosed HCL cases, usually receive either cladribine or pentostatin, which are both in a class of chemotherapeutic drugs known as purine analogs or nucleosides.
Patients with advanced-phase disease may be treated with cytotoxic drugs.
Patients with hairy cell leukemia who are symptom-free typically do not receive immediate treatment.
Patients with newly diagnosed disease also may be considered for stem cell transplantation (SCT), either from the bone marrow or other sources.
People who receive stem cell transplantation (SCT, alloBMT) require protective isolation in the hospital, including filtered air, sterile food, and sterilization of the microorganisms in the gut, until their total white blood cell (WBC) count is above 500.
People with intermediate or advanced disease may be helped by participation in a clinical trial.
Pre-treatment fertility measures (e.g., cryopreservation of semen prior to treatment; completion of a pregnancy prior to treatment) in young patients who have not completed their families.
Recent findings also suggest that low-dose cytarabine (ara-C), in combination with interferon, may be more beneficial than interferon alone.
Recurrent Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL) patients usually do not benefit from additional chemotherapy alone.
Significant research into the causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of leukemia is being done.
Studies may focus on effective means of treatment, better ways of treating the disease, improving the quality of life for patients, or appropriate care in remission or after cures.
Studies suggest that people with Stage A CLL (that is, individuals who have fewer than three areas of enlarged lymphoid tissue) do not benefit from early treatment.
Such combination chemotherapy usually offers the benefits of early remission (lessening of the disease) and a lower risk of disease resistance.
Symptoms that are related to enlargement of the lymph nodes in one area or an overgrown spleen may be treated by localized, low-dose radiotherapy or surgical management by splenectomy (removal of the spleen).
TB incidence varies widely, even in neighboring countries, apparently because of differences in health care systems.
The challenge of treating newly diagnosed Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) is to determine the best overall strategy to control the disease.
The emergence of drug-resistant strains has also contributed to this new epidemic with, from 2000 to 2004, 20% of TB cases being resistant to standard treatments and 2% resistant to second-line drugs.
The patient's blood is passed through a machine that removes the stem cells and then returns the blood to the patient.
The rise in HIV infections and the neglect of TB control programs have enabled a resurgence of tuberculosis.
The stem cells may or may not be treated with drugs to kill any cancer cells.
The stem cells then are stored until they are transplanted back into the patient.
These treatments are not typically given as the first treatment for a new patient because their success rates are lower than cladribine or pentostatin.
They are treated with drugs used in the management of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) - that is, prednisone, vincristine, and daunorubicin, with or without L-asparaginase.
They may be less able to tolerate the septicemia (blood poisoning) associated with granulocytopenia, and they often have higher rates of myelodysplastic ('preleukemia') syndrome (MDS).
They often are used to control blood counts in patients who cannot undergo SCT or who do not respond to interferon therapy because of age or medical considerations.
This procedure removes the chromosomal abnormality in a large percentage of patients and for them is curative.
This procedure will determine whether a compatible donor is available for stem cell transplantation.
Treatment is generally considered necessary when the patient shows signs and symptoms such as low blood cell counts, frequent infections, unexplained bruises, anemia, or fatigue that is significant enough to disrupt the patient's everyday life.
Treatment of central nervous system leukemia, if present, may involve injection of chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g., cytarabine or ara-C, methotrexate) into the areas around the brain and spinal cord.
Tuberculosis (abbreviated as TB for tubercle bacillus or Tuberculosis) is a common and deadly infectious disease caused by mycobacteria, mainly Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
Tuberculosis most commonly attacks the lungs (as pulmonary TB) but can also affect the central nervous system, the lymphatic system, the circulatory system, the genitourinary system, bones, joints and even the skin.
Unfortunately, it is estimated that only 7% of all AML patients will be cured using this procedure.
Unlike any other leukemia, HCL is characterized by low white blood cell counts.
Until recently, the treatment plans and responses of children with AML did not differ much from those of adults.
Whatever the plan, it is important for the patient to understand the treatment that is being given and the decision-making process behind the choice.
When the blood platelets are affected, it is called immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, in which a decreased numbers of platelets may lead to bleeding.
When the red blood cells are affected, the condition is known as immunohemolytic anemia, characterized by decreased numbers of red blood cells, which may cause fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath.
Yet new, more intensive induction and consolidation treatments have resulted in higher remission rates and prolonged survivals.
A survey of 6,000 primary care physicians in seven countries revealed disparities in several areas that affect quality of care.
Agencies have the flexibility to define this protocol within their continuity of operations plan guidelines.
Agencies may require certification of fitness to work from a health care provider.Agency heads are authorized to establish immediate telework arrangements, bypassing the normal requirements, as outlined in the agency internal teleworking policy and procedures, during the declared emergency.
All countries suffer from maldistribution characterized by urban concentration and rural deficits.
Alternative workers may include current employees who are not designated as mandatory but who possess the skills to fill in for mandatory employees, retirees, contract workers or other temporary employees.
Although all efforts should be made to allow non-mandatory employees to work from an alternative location, it may not always be possible.
Among the most important is the need to extend quality health care to all sectors of the population.
An agency may choose to practice social distancing by use of alternate worksites or teleworking.
An emergency lay-off may be declared if the agency remains totally closed or partially closed for an indefinite period of time due to the public health emergency.
An emergency layoff is a temporary separation from payroll because funds are not available, work is not available or because of another emergency situation requiring employees to remain away from the worksite.
Another tip is to crush tulsi paan and add a few drops of honey to this paste.
Deer mice have a white underbelly and their droppings are brown, rough and look like whole peppercorns.
Deer mice have been trapped in homes and outbuildings within the Capital Health Region, but they are more common in rural areas.
Developing countries face an even more critical disparity in primary care practitioners.
Differences did not follow trends of the cost of care; primary care physicians in the United States lagged behind their counterparts in other countries, despite the fact that the US spends two to three times as much per capita.
During an emergency layoff, employees who are laid off are entitled to participate in the State Health Plan. State agencies shall pay the employer contribution.
Each agency head shall predetermine and designate mandatory operations and designate the employees to staff these operations.
Each situation will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine appropriate action.
Each state agency will likewise adhere to any communicable disease orders of the State or local public health agencies to prevent transmission of a communicable disease.
Employees designated as mandatory personnel shall be notified of such designation and the requirement to report for, or remain at, work in emergency situations.
Employees required to work shall receive regular pay.
Employees who are on prearranged vacation leave or sick leave shall charge leave to the appropriate account until the end of the scheduled days off.
Employees who have symptoms of a communicable disease and are required to stay home or who are ill with the communicable disease should be cautioned not to return to work until they are sure that they are fully recovered.
Experience over the last 27 years shows that health system that adhere to the principles of primary health care produce greater efficiency and better health outcomes in terms of both individual and public health.
Growing gaps will exert even greater pressure on the outflow of health workers from poorer regions.
Hantavirus is breathed in when small particles that contain the virus become airborne.
Hantavirus is spread to people from deer mice who are infected with the virus or from their droppings, urine or saliva.
Heat some coconut oil with powdered camphor and allow it to cool down to a lukewarm state.
Heat the ball of cloth with an iron or 'tawa' and place it gently on your child's chest.
Humidifiers help too, but if you don't have one, place a wide pot filled with water in your child's bedroom.
I have tried this on my ten-month-old son, and it really works.
I have used this effective remedy for my 14 month old when he had a cold.
If a non-mandatory employee elects to work when the agency is closed, the employee shall not receive additional pay.
If adjustments need to be made, they shall be made in the next paycheck after returning to work, depending on payroll deadlines for that pay period.
If agency management believes that an employee has symptoms associated with a communicable disease, management may require the employee not to report to work and to use any available compensatory leave, sick leave, vacation leave or bonus leave.
If funds are not available, the employee shall be granted the additional half-time pay at a later date or one-half compensatory time.
If leave is not available, leave shall be advanced and paid back within 24 months.
If mandatory personnel are required to remain at the worksite for an extended period of time, the agency or university will provide adequate housing and food.
If quarantined, it is the employees’ responsibility to provide the agency with a written verification from a Public Health official.
If the employee becomes ill and it is determined to be work related in accordance with the Workers’ Compensation Act, the Workers’ Compensation Policy applies.
If the employee is isolated or becomes ill as result of off-the-job exposure, the Sick Leave Policy applies.
If you have cough/congestion, add a tablespoon of honey and the juice of half a lemon to a glass of warm water.
In 1998, half of internal medicine residents chose primary care, but by 2006, over 80% became specialists or hospitalists.
In 2004, the median income of specialists in the US was twice that of PCPs, and the gap is widening.
In case of a public health emergency, the Governor has broad powers to issue an emergency order to protect the public health.
In health systems, (primary care) workers function as gatekeepers and navigators for the effective, or wasteful, application of all other resources such as drugs, vaccines and supplies.
In many countries, the skills of limited yet expensive professionals are not well matched to the local profile of health needs.
In order to minimize transmission from person to person, each agency should have in place a Social Distancing Policy to implement immediately upon orders from the Governor and/or Public Health officials.
In the absence of such an order, the agency head shall consult with local/State Public Health officials to determine the severity of the individual situation and to determine what actions shall be taken.
In the United States, the number of medical students entering family practice training dropped by 50% between 1997 and 2005.
Make sure the cloth isn't so hot, that it would burn your baby's skin.
Management shall immediately notify the local health department.
Management shall inform employees and employees shall inform management of any evidence of a communicable disease that could seriously endanger the health of others in the workplace.
Management should stress to employees that they will not be penalized for using their leave, thereby encouraging those with symptoms associated with a communicable disease to stay home so that they do not infect other employees.
Mandatory employees may be excused from work if they are quarantined or ill, if they are required to care for a member of the immediate family who is quarantined or ill.
Once there, apply the oil to the chest, back, nose, throat and forehead.
Other major disparities include automated systems to remind patients about follow-up care, give patients test results or warn of harmful drug interactions.
Pending a decision on renewing these provisions, the employee may be allowed to take leave (compensatory, sick, vacation, bonus), if available, until a decision is made.
Primary care practices in the United States increasingly depend on foreign medical graduates to fill depleted ranks.
Richer countries face a future of low fertility and large populations of elderly people, which will cause a shift towards chronic and degenerative diseases with high care demands.
Shortages of primary care physicians are an increasing problem in many developed countries.
Social distancing is designed to limit the spread of a disease by reducing the opportunities for close contact between people.
The agency head shall determine the appropriate course of action in consultation with the Governor’s Office and the State Budget Director.
The agency head shall develop an alternative plan for personnel in case the designated personnel are unable to work.
The agency head shall make this decision after consultation with the Governor’s Office and the State Budget Director.
A 2005 study showed that a DNA TB vaccine given with conventional chemotherapy can accelerate the disappearance of bacteria as well as protect against re-infection in mice.
A very promising TB vaccine, MVA85A, is currently in phase II trials in South Africa by a group led by Oxford University,and is based on a genetically modified vaccinia virus.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), nearly 2 billion people—one–third of the world's population—have been exposed to the tuberculosis pathogen.
After the establishment in the 1880s that the disease was contagious, TB was made a notifiable disease in Britain.
Although it was established that the pulmonary form was associated with 'tubercles' by Dr Richard Morton in 1689, due to the variety of TB’s symptoms.
Although tuberculosis disease remained a significant threat to public health.
Annually, 8 million people become ill with tuberculosis, and 2 million people die from the disease worldwide.
Another folk belief attributed it to being forced, nightly, to attend fairy revels, so that the victim wasted away owing to lack of rest; this belief was most common when a strong connection was seen between the fairies and the dead.
BCG vaccine was the first vaccine for TB and developed at the Pasteur Institute in France between 1905 and 1921.
Because of the limitations of current vaccines, researchers and policymakers are promoting new economic models of vaccine development including prizes, tax incentives and advance market commitments.
Before the Industrial Revolution, tuberculosis may sometimes have been regarded as vampirism.
Co-infection with HIV is a particular problem in Sub-Saharan Africa, due to the high incidence of HIV in these countries.
DNA TB vaccine may take four to five years to be available in humans.
Due to the elimination of public health facilities in New York and the emergence of HIV, there was resurgence in the late 1980s.
During the years 1838–1845, Dr. John Croghan, the owner of Mammoth Cave, brought a number of tuberculosis sufferers into the cave in the hope of curing the disease with the constant temperature and purity of the cave air: they died within a year.
For example, tuberculosis cases in Britain, numbering around 117,000 in 1913, had fallen to around 5,000 in 1987, but cases rose again, and reaching 6,300 in 2000 and 7,600 cases in 2005.
Furthermore, people who had TB exhibited symptoms similar to what people considered to be vampire traits.
Genetic studies suggest that TB was present in South America for about 2,000 years.
Healthcare workers considered on an individual basis in settings in which a high percentage of MDR-TB patients has been found, transmission of MDR-TB is likely, and TB control precautions have been implemented and were not successful.
Here, surgical removal of chest cavities will reduce the number of bacteria in the lungs, as well as increasing the exposure of the remaining bacteria to drugs in the bloodstream, and is therefore thought to increase the effectiveness of the chemotherapy.
Hopes that the disease could be completely eliminated have been dashed since the rise of drug-resistant strains in the 1980s.
However, in countries where TB has gone from high to low incidence, such as the United States, TB is mainly a disease of older people.
However, mass vaccination with BCG did not start until after World War II.
However, the effectiveness of BCG is lower in areas where mycobacteria are less prevalent, therefore BCG is not given to the entire population in these countries.
However, whether tuberculosis originated in cattle and then transferred to humans, or diverged from a common ancestor, is currently unclear.
Ibn Sina developed the method of quarantine in order to limit the spread of tuberculosis.
Ibn Sina was the first physician to identify pulmonary tuberculosis as a contagious disease.
Identification of infections often involves testing high-risk groups for TB.
Immunizing against tuberculosis was called 'BCG' (Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin).
Improvements in public health were reducing tuberculosis even before the arrival of antibiotics.
In 1815, one in four deaths in England was of consumption; by 1918 one in six deaths in France were still caused by TB.
In 2004, around 14.6 million people had active TB disease with 9 million new cases.
In 2005, the country with the highest estimated incidence of TB was Swaziland, with 1262 cases per 100,000 people.
In Africa, TB primarily affects adolescents and young adults.
In developed countries, tuberculosis is less common and is mainly an urban disease.
In Europe, deaths from TB fell from 500 out of 100,000 in 1850 to 50 out of 100,000 by 1950.
In South Africa, the country with the highest prevalence of TB, BCG is given to all children under the age of three.
In South America, the earliest evidence of tuberculosis is associated with the Paracas-Caverna culture (circa 750 BC to circa 100 AD).
In the 20th century, tuberculosis killed an estimated 100 million people.
In the first, people with TB and their contacts are identified and then treated.
In the second approach, children are vaccinated to protect them from TB.
In the United Kingdom, TB incidences range from 40 per 100,000 in London to less than 5 per 100,000 in the rural South West of England; the national average is 13 per 100,000.
In the United States, concern about the spread of tuberculosis played a role in the movement to prohibit public spitting except into spittoons.
In the United States, the overall tuberculosis case rate was 4.9 per 100,000 persons in 2004.
In the USA, for example, BCG vaccine is not recommended except for people who meet specific criteria.
In tropical areas where the incidence of atypical mycobacteria is high, exposure to nontuberculous mycobacteria gives some protection against TB.
India has the largest number of infections, with over 1.8 million cases.
Infants or children with negative skin-test results who are continually exposed to untreated or ineffectively treated patients or will be continually exposed to multidrug-resistant TB.
It was also believed that TB sufferers acquired a final burst of energy just before they died which made women more beautiful and men more creative.
It was believed that TB sufferers who were artists had bursts of creativity as the disease progressed.
It was not until 1946 with the development of the antibiotic streptomycin that effective treatment and cure became possible.
Koch announced a glycerin extract of the tubercle bacilli as a "remedy" for tuberculosis in 1890, calling it 'tuberculin'.
Koch did not believe that bovine (cattle) and human tuberculosis were similar, which delayed the recognition of infected milk as a source of infection.
Many countries use BCG vaccine as part of their TB control programs, especially for infants.
Many people believed TB produced feelings of euphoria referred to as "Spes phthisica" or "hope of the consumptive".
People believed that tuberculosis was caused by the original victim draining the life from the other family members.
People with TB often have symptoms such as red, swollen eyes (which also creates a sensitivity to bright light), pale skin and coughing blood, suggesting the idea that the only way for the afflicted to replenish this loss of blood was by sucking blood.
Phthisis is a Greek term for tuberculosis; around 460 BC, Hippocrates identified phthisis as the most widespread disease of the times involving coughing up blood and fever, which was almost always fatal.
Prior to the introduction of antibiotic, the only treatment besides sanatoria was surgical interventions.
Public health campaigns tried to halt the spread of TB.
Robert Koch received the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1905 for this discovery.
Several new vaccines to prevent TB infection are being developed.
Skeletal remains show prehistoric humans (4000 BC) had TB, and tubercular decay has been found in the spines of mummies from 3000-2400 BC.
Smoking more than 20 cigarettes a day also increases the risk of TB by two- to four-times.
TB has again introduced surgery as part of the treatment for these infections.
TB prevention and control takes two parallel approaches.
TB was not identified as a single disease until the 1820s and was not named 'tuberculosis' until 1839 by J. L. Schönlein.
TB was romanticized in the nineteenth century.
The annual incidence rate varies from 356 per 100,000 in Africa to 41 per 100,000 in the Americas.
The bacillus causing tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was identified and described on March 24, 1882 by Robert Koch.
The BCG vaccine was first used on humans in 1921 in France.
The earliest unambiguous detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is in the remains of bison dated 18,000 years before the present.
The first genuine success in immunizing against tuberculosis was developed from attenuated bovine-strain tuberculosis by Albert Calmette and Camille Guerin in 1906.
The first recombinant tuberculosis vaccine entered clinical trials in the United States in 2004, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).
The first TB sanatorium opened in 1859 in Görbersdorf, Germany (today Sokolowsko, Poland) by Hermann Brehmer.
The first to recognize the association with diabetes, and the first to suggest that tuberculosis could spread through contact with soil and water.
The highest rates in Western Europe are in Portugal (42 per 100,000) and Spain (20 per 100,000).
The incidence of tuberculosis varies with age.
The number of those failing to complete their course of drugs is high.
The promotion of Christmas Seals began in Denmark during 1904 as a way to raise money for tuberculosis programs.
The promotion of Christmas Seals expanded to the United States and Canada in 1907–08 to help the National Tuberculosis Association (later called the American Lung Association).
The protective efficacy of BCG for preventing serious forms of TB (e.g. meningitis) in children is greater than 80%; its protective efficacy for preventing pulmonary TB in adolescents and adults is variable, ranging from 0 to 80%.
The resurgence of tuberculosis resulted in the declaration of a global health emergency by the World Health Organization in 1993.
The sanatoria for the middle and upper classes offered excellent care and constant medical attention.
The study of tuberculosis dates back to The Canon of Medicine written by Ibn Sina (Avicenna) in the 1020s.
There are a number of known factors that make people more susceptible to TB infection.
There were campaigns to stop spitting in public places, and the infected poor were "encouraged" to enter sanatoria that resembled prisons, in Britain.
These rates compare with 113 per 100,000 in China and 64 per 100,000 in Brazil.
Tubercular decay has been found in the spines of Egyptian mummies.
Tuberculin was not effective, but was later adapted as a test for pre-symptomatic tuberculosis.
Tuberculosis has been present in humans since antiquity.
Tuberculosis is the world's greatest infectious killer of women of reproductive age and the leading cause of death among people with HIV/AIDS.
Tuberculosis, or 'consumption' as it was commonly known, caused the most widespread public concern in the 19th and early 20th centuries as an endemic disease of the urban poor.
Unfortunately, no vaccine is available that provides reliable protection for adults.
Whatever the purported benefits of the fresh air and labor in the sanatoria, even under the best conditions, 50% of those who entered were dead within five years (1916).
When one member of a family died from tuberculosis, the other members that were infected would lose their health slowly.
When the Medical Research Council was formed in Britain in 1913 its initial focus was tuberculosis research.
A 9-year scientific study by an Independent Study Group of the likely efficacy of badger culling reported on 18 June 2007 that it was unlikely to be effective and could actually increase the spread of TB.
A number of misconceptions have arisen surrounding HIV/AIDS.
A small minority of scientists and activists question the connection between HIV and AIDS, the existence of HIV itself, or the validity of current testing and treatment methods.
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS or Aids) is a collection of symptoms and infections resulting from the specific damage to the immune system caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in humans, and similar viruses in other species (SIV, FIV, etc.).
Additionally, people with AIDS often have systemic symptoms of infection like fevers, sweats (particularly at night), swollen glands, chills, weakness, and weight loss.
After the diagnosis of AIDS is made, the current average survival time with antiretroviral therapy (as of 2005) is estimated to be more than 5 years.
AIDS dementia complex (ADC) is a metabolic encephalopathy induced by HIV infection and fueled by immune activation of HIV infected brain macrophages and microglia which secrete neurotoxins of both host and viral origin.
AIDS is the most severe acceleration of infection with HIV.
AIDS patients often develop opportunistic infections that present with non-specific symptoms, especially low-grade fevers and weight loss.
Although treatments for AIDS and HIV exist to decelerate the virus's progression, there is currently no known cure.
An effort to eradicate bovine tuberculosis from the cattle and deer herds of New Zealand is underway.
An example of this is people with the homozygous CCR5-?32 variation are resistant to infection with certain strains of HIV.
Antiretroviral treatment reduces both the mortality and the morbidity of HIV infection, but routine access to antiretroviral medication is not available in all countries.
As a result, governments have come under pressure from some quarters, primarily dairy farmers, to mount an active campaign of eradication of badgers in certain areas with the purpose of reducing the incidence of bovine TB.
As a result, the issue of badger culling remains hugely controversial in the United Kingdom.
Because Tuberculosis is transmissible to immunocompetent people via the respiratory route, is easily treatable once identified, may occur in early-stage HIV disease, and is preventable with drug therapy.
Before the advent of effective diagnosis, treatment and routine prophylaxis in Western countries, Pneumocystis jirovecii was a common immediate cause of death.
Caused by a gammaherpes virus called Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV), it often appears as purplish nodules on the skin, but can affect other organs, especially the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs.
Cervical cancer in HIV-infected women is considered AIDS-defining.
Cervical cancer is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV).
CMV can cause colitis, as described above, and CMV retinitis can cause blindness.
Cryptococcal meningitis can cause fevers, headache, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting.
Cryptococcal meningitis is an infection of the meninx (the membrane covering the brain and spinal cord) by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans.
Donnelly and Cox produced a sophisticated stochastic model of the badger population which was used to make detailed quantitative predictions about the effects of various policies.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or KSHV cause many of these lymphomas.
Esophagitis is an inflammation of the lining of the lower end of the esophagus (gullet or swallowing tube leading to the stomach).
High-grade B cell lymphomas such as Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkitt's-like lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and primary central nervous system lymphoma present more often in HIV-infected patients.
HIV is a retrovirus that primarily infects vital organs of the human immune system such as CD4+ T cells (a subset of T cells), macrophages and dendritic cells.
HIV is genetically variable and exists as different strains, which cause different rates of clinical disease progression.
HIV is transmitted through direct contact of a mucous membrane or the bloodstream with a bodily fluid containing HIV, such as blood, semen, vaginal fluid, preseminal fluid, and breast milk.
However, clinical staging of patients was not an intended use for these systems as they are neither sensitive, nor specific.
However, multidrug resistance is a potentially serious problem.
However, the incidence of many common tumors, such as breast cancer or colon cancer, does not increase in HIV-infected patients.
However, the rate of clinical disease progression varies widely between individuals, from two weeks up to 20 years.
In 2007, an estimated 33.2 million people lived with the disease worldwide, and it claimed the lives of an estimated 2.1 million people, including 330,000 children.
In addition to the AIDS-defining tumors listed above, HIV-infected patients are at increased risk of certain other tumors, such as Hodgkin's disease and anal and rectal carcinomas.
In advanced HIV infection, TB often presents atypically with extrapulmonary (systemic) disease a common feature.
In areas where HAART is extensively used to treat AIDS, the incidence of many AIDS-related malignancies has decreased.
In developing countries, it is still one of the first indications of AIDS in untested individuals, although it does not generally occur unless the CD4 count is less than 200 per µL
In early-stage HIV infection (CD4 count >300 cells per µL), TB typically presents as a pulmonary disease.
In HIV infected individuals, this is normally due to fungal (candidiasis) or viral (herpes simplex-1 or cytomegalovirus) infections.
In other jurisdictions, such as in Canada, AIDS is only diagnosed when a person infected with HIV is diagnosed with one or more of several AIDS-related opportunistic infections or cancers.
In some cases these lymphomas are AIDS-defining.
In some cases, diarrhea may be a side effect of several drugs used to treat HIV, or it may simply accompany HIV infection, particularly during primary HIV infection.
In some countries, such as the United States, this leads to a diagnosis of AIDS.
In some places, regulations aiming to prevent the spread of TB restrict the ownership of novelty pets; for example, the U.S. state of California forbids the ownership of pet gerbils.
In the absence of antiretroviral therapy, the median time of progression from HIV infection to AIDS is nine to ten years, and the median survival time after developing AIDS is only 9.2 months.
In the later stages of HIV infection, diarrhea is thought to be a reflection of changes in the way the intestinal tract absorbs nutrients, and may be an important component of HIV-related wasting.
In the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom, badgers have been identified as one vector species for the transmission of bovine tuberculosis.
It has been found that herd infection is more likely in areas where infected vector species such as Australian brush-tailed possums come into contact with domestic livestock at farm/bush borders.
It may also be a side effect of antibiotics used to treat bacterial causes of diarrhea (common for Clostridium difficile).
Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most common tumor in HIV-infected patients.
King's committee produced a report on 30th July, only one month after the publication of Bourne's 9-year study, whose conclusions flatly contradicted those of the Bourne report and recommended badger culling.
Malignant cancers overall have become the most common cause of death of HIV-infected patients.
Most of these conditions are infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites that are normally controlled by the elements of the immune system that HIV damages.
Most patients die from opportunistic infections or malignancies associated with the progressive failure of the immune system.
Most researchers believe that HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the twentieth century.
Mycobacterium bovis causes Tuberculosis in cattle.
New treatments continue to be developed and because HIV continues to evolve resistance to treatments, estimates of survival time are likely to continue to change.
Older people have weaker immune systems, and therefore have a greater risk of rapid disease progression than younger people.
Opportunistic infections are common in people with AIDS.
Other misconceptions are that any act of anal intercourse between gay men can lead to AIDS infection, and that open discussion of homosexuality and HIV in schools will lead to increased rates of homosexuality and AIDS.
Over three-fourths of these deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, retarding economic growth and destroying human capital.
Patients may also develop seizures and confusion; left untreated, it can be lethal.
Patients with HIV infection have substantially increased incidence of several malignant cancers.
Penicilliosis due to Penicillium marneffei is now the third most common opportunistic infection (after extrapulmonary tuberculosis and cryptococcosis) in HIV-positive individuals within the endemic area of Southeast Asia.
People with AIDS also have an increased risk of developing various cancers such as Kaposi's sarcoma, cervical cancer and cancers of the immune system known as lymphomas.
PML is caused by a virus called JC virus which occurs in 70% of the population in latent form, causing disease only when the immune system has been severely weakened, as is the case for AIDS patients.
Pneumocystis pneumonia (originally known as Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and still abbreviated as PCP, which now stands for Pneumocystis pneumonia) is relatively rare in healthy, immunocompetent people, but common among HIV-infected individuals.
Poor access to health care and the existence of coexisting infections such as tuberculosis also may predispose people to faster disease progression.
Prevalence is 10–20% in Western countries but only 1–2% of HIV infections in India.
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating disease, in which the gradual destruction of the myelin sheath covering the axons of nerve cells impairs the transmission of nerve impulses.
Since June 5, 1981, many definitions have been developed for epidemiological surveillance such as the Bangui definition and the 1994 expanded World Health Organization AIDS case definition.
Specific neurological impairments are manifested by cognitive, behavioral, and motor abnormalities that occur after years of HIV infection and is associated with low CD4+ T cell levels and high plasma viral loads.
Symptoms are usually constitutional and are not localized to one particular site, often affecting bone marrow, bone, urinary and gastrointestinal tracts, liver, regional lymph nodes, and the central nervous system.
The appearance of KS tumor in young homosexual men in 1981 was one of the first signals of the AIDS epidemic.
The effectiveness of culling on the incidence of TB in cattle is a contentious issue, with proponents and opponents citing their own studies to support their position.
The Independent Study Group was chaired by Sir John Bourne and included two statisticians, Professor Cristl Donnelly and Sir David Cox, the most distinguished statistician in the United Kingdom.
The infected person's genetic inheritance plays an important role and some people are resistant to certain strains of HIV.
The King committee did not include any statisticians and did not make use of the Donnelly and Cox statistical model.
The late stage of the condition leaves individuals susceptible to opportunistic infections and tumors.
The rate of clinical disease progression varies widely between individuals and has been shown to be affected by many factors such as host susceptibility and immune function health care and co-infections, as well as factors relating to the viral strain.
The recommendations of the Bourne report came as a surprise to Ministers.
The specific opportunistic infections that AIDS patients develop depend in part on the prevalence of these infections in the geographic area in which the patient lives.
The symptoms of AIDS are primarily the result of conditions that do not normally develop in individuals with healthy immune systems.
The UK government has not committed itself on the issue, not least because it fears public opinion: badgers are a protected species.
The UK Government's Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir David King convened a committee to re-examine the Bourne report.
The use of highly active antiretroviral therapy prolongs both the median time of progression to AIDS and the median survival time.
These include infection with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare and cytomegalovirus (CMV).
These particular cancers often foreshadow a poor prognosis.
This is primarily due to co-infection with an oncogenic DNA virus, especially Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV), and human papilloma virus (HPV).
This transmission can come in the form of anal, vaginal or oral sex, blood transfusion, contaminated hypodermic needles, exchange between mother and baby during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding, or other exposure to one of the above bodily fluids.
Three of the most common are that AIDS can spread through casual contact, that sexual intercourse with a virgin will cure AIDS, and that HIV can infect only homosexual men and drug users.
Toxoplasmosis is a disease caused by the single-celled parasite called Toxoplasma gondii; it usually infects the brain causing toxoplasma encephalitis but it can infect and cause disease in the eyes and lungs.
Tuberculosis (TB) is unique among infections associated with HIV.
Tuberculosis can be carried by mammals; domesticated species, such as cats and dogs, are generally free of tuberculosis, but wild animals may be carriers.
Unexplained chronic diarrhea in HIV infection is due to many possible causes, including common bacterial (Salmonella, Shigella, Listeria, Campylobacter, or Escherichia coli).
When HIV kills CD4+ T cells so that there are fewer than 200 CD4+ T cells per microliter (µL) of blood, cellular immunity is lost.
Without antiretroviral therapy, death normally occurs within a year.
A number of factors influence the risk of infection, particularly the viral load of the mother at birth (the higher the viral load, the higher the risk).
Additionally, many nations have decriminalized needle possession and made it possible to buy injection equipment from pharmacists without a prescription.
All AIDS-prevention organizations advise drug-users not to share needles and other material required to prepare and take drugs (including syringes, cotton balls, the spoons, water for diluting the drug, straws, crack pipes, etc).
An undetectable plasma viral load does not necessarily indicate a low viral load in the seminal liquid or genital secretions.
Approximately 30% of women in ten countries representing "diverse cultural, geographical and urban/rural settings" report that their first sexual experience was forced or coerced, making sexual violence a key driver of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
Breastfeeding increases the risk of transmission by 4.04%.
Countries such as Uganda are attempting to curb the MTCT epidemic by offering VCT (voluntary counseling and testing), PMTCT (prevention of mother-to-child transmission) and ANC (ante-natal care) services, which include the distribution of antiretroviral therapy.
Current optimal HAART options consist of combinations (or "cocktails") consisting of at least three drugs belonging to at least two types, or "classes," of antiretroviral agents.
Current recommendations state that when replacement feeding is acceptable, feasible, affordable, sustainable and safe, HIV-infected mothers should avoid breast-feeding their infant.
Current treatment for HIV infection consists of highly active antiretroviral therapy, or HAART.
Defenders of the Catholic Church's role in AIDS and general STD prevention state that, while they may be against the use of contraception, they are strong advocates of abstinence outside marriage.
Detection of the virus using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) during the window period is possible, and evidence suggests that an infection may often be detected earlier than when using a fourth generation EIA screening test.
Donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are screened for HIV.
Drug abuse has an additional effect of an increased tendency to engage in unprotected sexual intercourse.
During a sexual act, only male or female condoms can reduce the chances of infection with HIV and other STDs and the chances of becoming pregnant.
Each 10-fold increment of blood plasma HIV RNA is associated with an 81% increased rate of HIV transmission.
Epidemiological studies from sub-Saharan Africa, Europe and North America have suggested that there is approximately a four times greater risk of becoming infected with HIV in the presence of a genital ulcer.
Evaluations of several abstinence-only programs in the US showed a negative impact on the willingness of youths to use contraceptives, due to the emphasis on contraceptives' failure rates.
Furthermore, only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities are counseled, tested or receive their test results.
Furthermore, South African medical experts are concerned that the repeated use of unsterilized blades in the ritual circumcision of adolescent boys may be spreading HIV.
Health care workers (nurses, laboratory workers, doctors etc) are also concerned, although more rarely.
HIV infection can only be diagnosed by PCR, testing for HIV pro-viral DNA in the children's lymphocytes.
HIV tests are usually performed on venous blood.
However, according to the WHO, the overwhelming majority of the world's population does not have access to safe blood and "between 5% and 10% of HIV infections worldwide are transmitted through the transfusion of infected blood and blood products".
However, at present availability of female condoms is very low and the price remains prohibitive for many women.
However, if this is not the case, exclusive breast-feeding is recommended during the first months of life and discontinued as soon as possible.
However, no evidence has been produced that promotion of condom use increases sexual promiscuity, and abstinence-only programs have been unsuccessful in the United States both in changing sexual behavior and in reducing HIV transmission.
If necessary, manufacturers recommend using water-based lubricants.
In 2005, around 700,000 children under 15 contracted HIV, mainly through MTCT, with 630,000 of these infections occurring in Africa.
In Africa, the number of MTCT and the prevalence of AIDS is beginning to reverse decades of steady progress in child survival.
In December 2006, the last of three large, randomized trials confirmed that male circumcision lowers the risk of HIV infection among heterosexual African men by around 50%.
In Europe and the United States, condoms have to conform to European (EC 600) or American (D3492) standards to be considered protective against HIV transmission.
In some developed countries, clean needles are available free in some cities, at needle exchanges or safe injection sites.
In the absence of treatment, the transmission rate between the mother to the child during pregnancy, labor and delivery is 25%.
Individuals whose first specimen indicates evidence of HIV infection will have a repeat test on a second blood sample to confirm the results.
Infectivity seems to vary during the course of illness and is not constant between individuals.
Information on cleaning needles using bleach is available from health care and addiction professionals and from needle exchanges.
It is expected that this intervention will be actively promoted in many of the countries worst affected by HIV, although doing so will involve confronting a number of practical, cultural and attitudinal issues.
It is important that people use new or properly sterilized needles for each injection.
It is possible to find HIV in the saliva, tears, and urine of infected individuals, but there are no recorded cases of infection by these secretions, and the risk of infection is negligible.
Latex condoms degrade over time, making them porous, which is why condoms have expiration dates.
Less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa has been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations.
Manufacturers recommend that oil-based lubricants such as petroleum jelly, butter, and lard not be used with latex condoms, because they dissolve the latex, making the condoms porous.
Many laboratories use fourth generation screening tests which detect anti-HIV antibody (IgG and IgM) and the HIV p24 antigen.
Many people are unaware that they are infected with HIV.
Many religious groups, most noticeably the Roman Catholic Church, have opposed the use of condoms on religious grounds, and have sometimes seen condom promotion as an affront to the promotion of marriage, monogamy and sexual morality.
Medical workers who follow universal precautions or body-substance isolation, such as wearing latex gloves when giving injections and washing the hands frequently, can help prevent infection by HIV.
Needle sharing is the cause of one third of all new HIV-infections and 50% of hepatitis C infections in North America, China, and Eastern Europe.
Of the children currently living with HIV, almost 90% live in sub-Saharan Africa.
Oil-based lubricants can however be used with polyurethane condoms.
Oral sex is not without its risks as HIV is transmissible through both insertive and receptive oral sex.
People who are infected with HIV can still be infected by other, more virulent strains.
PEP also has very unpleasant side effects including diarrhea, malaise, nausea and fatigue.
PEP has a very demanding four week schedule of dosage.
Positive results obtained by PCR are confirmed by antibody tests.
Post-exposure prophylaxis with anti-HIV drugs can further reduce that small risk.
Preliminary studies suggest that, where female condoms are available, overall protected sexual acts increase relative to unprotected sexual acts, making them an important HIV prevention strategy.
Promoting condom use, however, has often proved controversial and difficult.
Routinely used HIV tests for infection in neonates, born to HIV-positive mothers, have no value because of the presence of maternal antibody to HIV in the child's blood.
Sexual assault greatly increases the risk of HIV transmission as protection is rarely employed and physical trauma to the vaginal cavity frequently occurs which facilitates the transmission of HIV.
Sexual transmission occurs with the contact between sexual secretions of one partner with the rectal, genital or oral mucous membranes of another.
Sexually transmitted infections (STI) increase the risk of HIV transmission and infection.
Sharing and reusing syringes contaminated with HIV-infected blood represents a major risk for infection with not only HIV, but also hepatitis B and hepatitis C.
Some experts fear that a lower perception of vulnerability among circumcised men may result in more sexual risk-taking behavior, thus negating its preventive effects.
Studies have shown that antiretroviral drugs, caesarean delivery and formula feeding reduce the chance of transmission of HIV from mother to child.
Studies on couples where one partner is infected show that with consistent condom use, HIV infection rates for the uninfected partner are below 1% per year.
The best evidence to date indicates that typical condom use reduces the risk of heterosexual HIV transmission by approximately 80% over the long-term, though the benefit is likely to be higher if condoms are used correctly on every occasion.
The detection of HIV antibody or antigen in a patient previously known to be negative is evidence of HIV infection.
The effective use of condoms and screening of blood transfusion in North America, Western and Central Europe is credited with contributing to the low rates of AIDS in these regions.
The female condom contains an inner ring, which keeps the condom in place inside the vagina – inserting the female condom requires squeezing this ring.
The female condom is an alternative to the male condom and is made from polyurethane, which allows it to be used in the presence of oil-based lubricants.
The female condoms are larger than male condoms and have a stiffened ring-shaped opening, and are designed to be inserted into the vagina.
The majority of HIV infections are acquired through unprotected sexual relations between partners, one of whom has HIV.
The male latex condom, if used correctly without oil-based lubricants, is the single most effective available technology to reduce the sexual transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.
The only known methods of prevention are based on avoiding exposure to the virus or, failing that, an antiretroviral treatment directly after a highly significant exposure, called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).
The primary mode of HIV infection worldwide is through sexual contact between members of the opposite sex.
The risk of being infected with HIV from a single prick with a needle that has been used on an HIV-infected person is thought to be about 1 in 150 (see table above).
The risk of HIV transmission from exposure to saliva is considerably smaller than the risk from exposure to semen; contrary to popular belief, one would have to swallow liters of saliva from a carrier to run a significant risk of becoming infected.
The risk of transmitting HIV to blood transfusion recipients is extremely low in developed countries where improved donor selection and HIV screening is performed.
The three main transmission routes of HIV are sexual contact, exposure to infected body fluids or tissues and from mother to fetus or child during prenatal period.
The transmission of the virus from the mother to the child can occur in utero during the last weeks of pregnancy and at childbirth.
The United Nations General Assembly, supported by universal medical opinion on the matter, has urged the nations of the world to implement universal precautions to prevent HIV transmission in health care settings.
The WHO estimates that approximately 2.5% of all HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa are transmitted through unsafe healthcare injections.
The window period (the time between initial infection and the development of detectable antibodies against the infection) can vary since it can take 3–6 months to seroconvert and to test positive.
There is also a significant though lesser increased risk in the presence of STIs such as gonorrhea, Chlamydial infection and trichomoniasis which cause local accumulations of lymphocytes and macrophages.
There is currently no vaccine or cure for HIV or AIDS.
They also believe that the distribution and promotion of condoms is tantamount to promoting sex amongst the youth and sending the wrong message to uninfected individuals.
This attitude is also found among some health care providers and policy makers in sub-Saharan African nations, where HIV and AIDS prevalence is extremely high.
This has been highly beneficial to many HIV-infected individuals since its introduction in 1996 when the protease inhibitor-based HAART initially became available.
This risk depends on clinical factors and may vary according to the pattern and duration of breast-feeding.
This route can affect people who give and receive tattoos and piercings.
Transmission of HIV between intravenous drug users has clearly decreased, and HIV transmission by blood transfusion has become quite rare in developed countries.
Transmission of HIV depends on the infectiousness of the index case and the susceptibility of the uninfected partner.
Transmission route is particularly relevant to intravenous drug users, hemophiliacs and recipients of blood transfusions and blood products.
Typical regimens consist of two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NARTIs or NRTIs) plus either a protease inhibitor or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI).
Universal precautions are frequently not followed in both sub-Saharan Africa and much of Asia because of both a shortage of supplies and inadequate training.
Unprotected receptive sexual acts are riskier than unprotected insertive sexual acts, with the risk for transmitting HIV from an infected partner to an uninfected partner through unprotected anal intercourse greater than the risk for transmission through vaginal intercourse or oral sex.
When the mother has access to antiretroviral therapy and gives birth by caesarean section, the rate of transmission is just 1%.
With consistent and correct use of condoms, there is a very low risk of HIV infection.
Women are more susceptible to HIV-1 infection due to hormonal changes, vaginal microbial ecology and physiology, and a higher prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases.
A number of studies have shown that measures to prevent opportunistic infections can be beneficial when treating patients with HIV infection or AIDS.
A plasma sample taken in 1959 from an adult male living in Kinshasa, today part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
A recent study states that HIV probably moved from Africa to Haiti and then entered the United States around 1969.
A study in Côte d'Ivoire showed that households with an HIV/AIDS patient spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households.
According to scientific consensus, this scenario is not supported by the available evidence.
Adult prevalence in 2007 was an estimated 5.0%, and AIDS continued to be the single largest cause of mortality in Sub-Saharan region.
After over 20 years of research, HIV-1 remains a difficult target for a vaccine.
AIDS stigma exists around the world in a variety of ways, including ostracism, rejection, discrimination and avoidance of HIV infected people.
An estimated 2.5 million (range 1.8–4.1 million) people were newly infected in 2007, including 420,000 children.
An increase in workers’ time off to look after sick family members or for sick leave will also lower productivity.
Both HIV-1 and HIV-2 are of primate origin.
By killing off mainly young adults, AIDS seriously weakens the taxable population.
Compulsory HIV testing without prior consent or protection of confidentiality; violence against HIV infected individuals or people who are perceived to be infected with HIV.
Conclusions reached from models of the growth trajectories of 30 sub-Saharan economies over the period 1990–2025 were that the economic growth rates of these countries would be between 0.56 and 1.47% lower.
Courtesy AIDS stigma is stigmatization of people connected to the issue of HIV/AIDS or HIV- positive people.
Daily multivitamin and mineral supplements have been found to reduce HIV disease progression among men and women.
Despite recent, improved access to antiretroviral treatment and care in many regions of the world, the AIDS pandemic claimed an estimated 2.1 million (range 1.9–2.4 million) lives in 2007 of which an estimated 330,000 were children under 15 years.
Despite the widespread use of complementary and alternative medicine by people living with HIV/AIDS, the effectiveness of these therapies has not been established.
Examples of alternative medicine that people hoped would improve their symptoms or their quality of life include massage, stress management, herbal and flower remedies such as boxwood, and acupuncture.
Globally, an estimated 33.2 million people lived with HIV in 2007, including 2.5 million children.
HAART allows the stabilization of the patient’s symptoms and viremia, but it neither cures the patient of HIV, nor alleviates the symptoms, and high levels of HIV-1, often HAART resistant, return once treatment is stopped.
HAART is thought to increase survival time by between 4 and 12 years.
HIV and AIDS retard economic growth by destroying human capital.
HIV disease progression in children is more rapid than in adults.
HIV found in tissue samples from "Robert R.", a 15 year old African-American teenager who died in St. Louis in 1969.
HIV found in tissue samples from ArvidNoe, a Norwegian sailor who died around 1976.
In 2000, the rate of growth of Africa's per capita GDP was in fact reduced by 0.7% per year from 1990–1997 with a further 0.3% per year lower in countries also affected by malaria.
In areas where it is widely available, the development of HAART as effective therapy for HIV infection and AIDS reduced the death rate from this disease by 80%.
In developed countries where HAART is available, doctors assess the viral load, rapidity in CD4 decline, and patient readiness while deciding when to recommend initiating treatment.
In many developed countries, there is an association between AIDS and homosexuality or bisexuality, and this association is correlated with higher levels of sexual prejudice such as anti-homosexual attitudes.
In some heavily infected areas, the epidemic has left behind many orphans cared for by elderly grandparents.
In the absence of HAART, progression from HIV infection to AIDS occurs at a median of between nine to ten years and the median survival time after developing AIDS is only 9.2 months.
In the first decade of the epidemic when no useful conventional treatment was available, a large number of people with AIDS experimented with alternative therapies.
Increased mortality will also weaken the mechanisms that generate human capital and investment in people, through loss of income and the death of parents.
Indeed, since 1992 predictions that AIDS would slow economic growth in these countries have been published.
India has an estimated 2.5 million infections and an estimated adult prevalence of 0.36%.
Indirectly there are also important implications on the supply chain.
Instrumental AIDS stigma is a reflection of the fear and apprehension that are likely to be associated with any deadly and transmissible illness.
It has been postulated that only a vaccine can halt the pandemic because a vaccine would possibly cost less, thus being affordable for developing countries, and would not require daily treatments.
Laboratory parameters are less predictive of risk for disease progression, particularly for young infants, treatment recommendations are more aggressive for children than for adults.
Life expectancy has fallen dramatically in the worst-affected countries; for example, in 2006 it was estimated that it had dropped from 65 to 35 years in Botswana.
Major psychosocial issues, such as poor access to medical care, inadequate social supports, psychiatric disease and drug abuse contribute to non-adherence.
Many governments in sub-Saharan Africa denied that there was a problem for years, and are only now starting to work towards solutions.
Many HIV-infected individuals have experienced remarkable improvements in their general health and quality of life, which has led to the plummeting of HIV-associated morbidity and mortality.
Many multi-national corporations (MNCs) have therefore gotten involved in HIV/AIDS initiatives of three main types: a community-based partnerships, supply chain support, and sector-based initiatives.
Many patients may benefit from prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and Cryptococcus meningitis as well.
Moreover, it would take more than the lifetime of an individual to be cleared of HIV infection using HAART.
Most experts believe that HIV probably transferred to humans as a result of direct contact with primates, for instance during hunting or butchery.
Non-adherence and non-persistence with antiretroviral therapy is the major reason most individuals fail to get any benefit from and develop resistance to HAART.
ODI is estimated that a company can generate an average return of US$3 for every US$1 invested in employee health due to a reduced absenteeism, better productivity and reduction in employee turnover.
Often, AIDS stigma is expressed in conjunction with one or more other stigmas, particularly those associated with homosexuality, bisexuality, promiscuity, and intravenous drug use.
On the level of the household, AIDS results in both the loss of income and increased spending on healthcare by the household.
Other regions, most people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa in 2007 (61%) were women.
Patients with substantial immune suppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP).
Recent research by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) has suggested that the private sector has begun to recognize the impact of HIV/AIDS on the bottom line, both directly and indirectly.
Reducing the resources available for public expenditures such as education and health services not related to AIDS resulting in increasing pressure for the state's finances and slower growth of the economy.
Research to improve current treatments includes decreasing side effects of current drugs, further simplifying drug regimens to improve adherence, and determining the best sequence of regimens to manage drug resistance.
Some individual nutrients have also been tried. Anti-retroviral drugs are expensive, and the majority of the world's infected individuals do not have access to medications and treatments for HIV and AIDS.
South Africa has the largest population of HIV patients in the world, followed by Nigeria and India.
South and South East Asia are second worst affected; in 2007 this region contained an estimated 18% of all people living with AIDS, and an estimated 300,000 deaths from AIDS.
Sub-Saharan Africa remains by far the worst affected region.
Symbolic AIDS stigma is the use of HIV/AIDS to express attitudes toward the social groups or lifestyles perceived to be associated with the disease.
The AIDS pandemic can also be seen as several epidemics of separate subtypes.
The complexity of these HAART regimens, whether due to pill number, dosing frequency, meal restrictions or other issues, along with side effects that create intentional non-adherence, also has a weighty impact.
The Copenhagen Consensus is a project that seeks to establish priorities for advancing global welfare using methodologies based on the theory of welfare economics.
The definition of "alternative therapies" in AIDS has changed since that time.
The degree of impact depended on assumptions about the extent to which illness would be funded by savings and who would be infected.
The economists estimated that an investment of $27 billion could avert nearly 30 million new infections by 2010.
The forecast is that AIDS will likely cause a collapse of economies and societies in the region.
The forecast now is that the growth of GDP for these countries will undergo a further reduction of between 0.5 and 2.6% per annum.
The highest priority was assigned to implementing new measures to prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS.
The impact on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was less conclusive.
The income effects of this lead to spending reduction as well as a substitution effect away from education and towards healthcare and funeral spending.
The increased mortality in this region will result in a smaller skilled population and labor force.
The major factors in AIDS’s spread are sexual transmission and vertical transmission from mother to child at birth and through breast milk.
The median survival rate after diagnosis of AIDS in resource-limited settings where treatment is not available ranges between 6 and 19 months, depending on the study.
The origin of HIV-1 is the Central Common Chimpanzee (Pan troglodyte’s troglodytes) found in southern Cameroon.
The package disposes, among other things, categorized guidelines on clinical management, education and counselling of AIDS victims at community level.
The package, which is in form of eight modules focusing on basic facts about HIV and AIDS, was pre-tested in Zimbabwe in March 2006 to determine its adaptability.
The participants are all economists, with the focus of the project being a rational prioritization based on economic analysis.
The project is based on the contention that, in spite of the billions of dollars spent on global challenges by the United Nations, the governments of wealthy nations, foundations, charities, and non-governmental organizations.
The reasons for non-adherence and non-persistence with HAART are varied and overlapping.
The side effects include lipodystrophy, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance, an increase in cardiovascular risks and birth defects.
There is also a perceived association between AIDS and all male-male sexual behavior, including sex between uninfected men.
These estimates may be an underestimate, as they do not look at the effects on output per capita.
They will not only be unable to work, but will also require significant medical care.
This average reflects the fact that for some patients – and in many clinical cohorts this may be more than fifty percent of patients – HAART achieves far less than optimal results.
This could become an important low-cost intervention provided during early HIV disease to prolong the time before antiretroviral therapy is required.
This is due to a variety of reasons such as medication intolerance/side effects, prior ineffective antiretroviral therapy and infection with a drug-resistant strain of HIV.
This is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility and blame from the family to the government in caring for these orphans.
This results in a slower growth of the tax base, an effect that will be reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick, training (to replace sick workers), sick pay and caring for AIDS orphans.
This smaller labor force will be predominantly young people, with reduced knowledge and work experience leading to reduced productivity.
Two species of HIV infect humans: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is more virulent and more easily transmitted. HIV-1 is the source of the majority of HIV infections throughout the world.
UNAIDS, WHO and the United Nations Development Programme have documented a correlation between the decreasing life expectancies and the lowering of gross national product in many African countries with prevalence rates of 10% or more.
Underfunding is a problem in all areas of HIV prevention when compared to even conservative estimates of the problems.
Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for patients who are not infected with these viruses and are at risk of becoming infected.
Various forms of alternative medicine have been used to treat symptoms or alter the course of the disease.
While HIV-2 is not as easily transmitted and is largely confined to West Africa.
Without proper nutrition, health care and medicine that is available in developed countries, large numbers of people in these countries is falling victim to AIDS.
Without treatment, the net median survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years, depending on the HIV subtype.
A plan for a “minimum package” for nutritional health was introduced to the workshop by Dr. Chavez of the National Institute for Nutrition in Mexico city.
A review of the literature revels that most studies of adult education and child nutrition have focused on parents only.
A test for trend was undertaken by applying the likelihood ratio test between a model in which the categorical variable is specified as continuous and a model excluding this variable altogether.
A three-level model is used to account for the hierarchical structure of the data, 32 33 in which level 1 refers to measurements of the individual child and the child’s household, level 2 the community and level 3 the site.
Although the data are not nationally representative, we will here after refer to the data being from “India” and “Vietnam”
Anthropometric indices were used as indicators of child nutrition, following procedures recommended by the World Health Organization.
Before interview, informed consent was obtained from participants.
Between four to six months children will begin to need some supplementary feeding, depending on the mother’s milk output and the individual physiological needs of the particular child.
Between-country differences may also be the result of methodological factors, such as the size and structure of the two datasets.
Both methodological and cultural factors thus lie behind the between-country differences observed.
Breast-milk is likely to be far better, nutritionally, than any other food the child will receive, particularly in the developing world.
Child nutrition is positively and independently associated with mothers’, fathers’ and grand mothers’ education.
Children were classified as “stunted”(an indicator of chronic malnutrition) if they have height-for-age z scores below-2SDand “underweight” (indicator of both chronic and acute malnutrition) if they have weight-for-age z scores below-2SD.
Community-level maternal literacy was measured as the proportion of mothers, who were illiterate in the community, as estimated from the sample (data on paternal literacy was not available).
Confounders were selected on the basis of UNICEF’s model for the determinants of mal nutrition, which incorporates biological and socio economic causes at both micro and macro levels.
Cross-sectional data were analysed for 5692 children from Andhra Pradesh State in India and Vietnam sampled within “sites” (20 from each country) and then within “communities”(31 from Vietnam and 102 from India).
Despite recent improvements, approximately half of preschool children remain underweight in Asia, which is the highest level in the world.
Despite the economic transition of the past 20 years, Vietnam’s social structure is still largely influenced by the socialist planned economy.
Despite these weaknesses these small study has succeeded in linking a number of key issues of interest among educationalists, economists, nutritionists and highlighting synergies.
Detailed information on the study design and sampling methods has been published elsewhere.
The dietary supplementation of the mother does not boost volumes above this level, although there is strong circumstantial evidence that, as during pregnancy.
Educated people often create demand for services and infrastructure and tend to have more political clout than less educated populations.
Education is viewed as a key element in the overall strategy for reducing malnutrition in the developing world.
Education was measured by asking the respondent what level of formal schooling each household member had completed.
Education-effects were similar for both height and weight-for-age z-scores, suggesting they operate over the medium to longer term.
Ethical clearance was obtained from participating research institutions in the United Kingdom and each Young Lives study country.
Exact p values are presented in the text and statistical significance was assumed at the 5% level, except for statistical interactions, which used the 10% level.
Few have examined the effect of education among other household of community members, although recent research suggest that these “others” may play an important role in determining child nutrition.
First it supports existing efforts to universalise basic education and adult literacy programmes, as education is positively associated with child nutrition.
For descriptive analysis we used chi-squared tests, Student’s t-test and F-tests to assess the statistical significance of differences between proportions, two means or more than two means, respectively.
For grandmothers, all educational categories were combined because only a small number of grandmothers had secondary or higher education.
Furthermore, one should bear in mind, when interpreting the results, that the data were cross-sectional, meaning that causality cannot be proved and that further longitudinal research would be necessary to corroborate the findings.
Grandmothers in India and communes in Vietnam are known to exert strong influences on childcare, so it is not unexpected that this study finds an effect of their education.
Households were selected using a method equivalent to random sampling.
If, however, employment draws mothers away from childcare at home, the presence of other household members who are better educated than the mother may offer the potential for an improvement in the overall quality of childcare.
In addition, programmatic research is needed to explore practical ways in which to involve influential household and community members including mother-in-laws, teachers and local leaders, in nutritional interventions to increase programme effectiveness.
In both countries there has been concern that economic advances have not been reflected in improvements in child nutrition.
In India 62 million children are underweight and in Vietnam there are 5 million.
In India, education has been shown to explain the spatial clustering of malnutrition and death, and even low levels of education have been shown to increase child survival prospects and health-related behaviours.
In school, girls can acquire skills that are later used to access modern health services and comprehend health messages.
In the developing countries there can be no doubt that both mothers and their young children constitute the group most clinically vulnerable to malnutrition.
In the other sample (Vietnam), child nutrition is positively associated with community-level maternal literacy.
In the Vietnam sample, child nutrition was associated with the proportion of literate mothers in the community, adjusting for parental education and other confounders (height 0.81, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.31, p = 0.002).
In Vietnam, a recent study using two nationally representative surveys found no significant effect of maternal education on child nutrition.
It has been argued that children’s greater "exposure time" to mothers explains why the effect of education is greater for mothers than fathers, as fathers tend to work outside the home.
It is apparent that adults have a higher level of schooling in Vietnam than in Andhra Pradesh (p less than 0.001), which also corresponds to previous literature.
It is clear that the dietary intake of many pregnant and lactating mothers in the Third World is well below current recommendations both for energy and many nutrients.
It is frequently claimed that we know enough to bring about a significant improvement in nutritional health.
It is plausible that fathers, often heading the households, make decisions and behave in ways that directly or indirectly affect childcare.
It is plausible that the common approach of targeting women of reproductive age for health or nutrition interventions may overlook "influential others" in childcare and therefore miss useful avenues of influence.
It is well established that mothers’ education has a positive effect on child nutrition in developing countries.
It is well established that mothers’ education has a positive effect on child nutrition in developing countries.
It supports previous studies that have highlighted the role of grandmothers in determining health and fertility behaviour, whether "positively" or "negatively", and which call for a greater participation of grandmothers in behavioural-change interventions.
Less explored is the effect exerted by the education of other individuals—mothers’ friends, neighbors and family.
Less explored, however, is the effect exerted by the education of other individuals—mothers’ friends, neighbors and family—who may influence child nutrition directly (though childcare) or indirectly (though modification of the effect of maternal education).
Literacy was assessed by asking "Can you read and understand a letter or newspaper easily, with difficulty, or not at all, in any language?”
Multilevel regression analysis was undertaken to account for confounders and geographical clustering of observations.
Multivariable regression analysis was used to adjust simultaneously for multiple confounders.
Now that a growing number of women in India and Vietnam are taking up employment outside the household, the role of other carers such as grandmothers and siblings is likely to become increasingly important in determining child nutrition.
Particularly interesting, given the lack of previous evidence, is the finding that child nutrition in one sample (India) is positively associated with grandmothers’ education.
Particularly interesting, given the lack of previous evidence, is the positive association shown between child nutrition and grandmothers’ education in India and community-level maternal literacy in Vietnam.
Sentinel sites, and the communities within the sites, were selected semi purposively.
Similarly, the lack of an effect of grandmothers’ education in Vietnam (in contrast with India) may be explained, partly at least, by the small number of grandmothers included in the sample.
Some children are able to grow and function for longer than six months on breast-milk alone, but equally, other children may need supplementation before four months.
Statistical interactions were assessed by entering a dummy interaction term into the model.
Study uses cross-sectional data from the first round of the Young Lives study (in 2002) in Vietnam and Andhra Pradesh State in south India.
The adjusted mean difference in height-for-age z-scores between boys living with an educated grandmother and those not was 0.64 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.99, p less than 0.001).
The association with grandmothers’ education was statistically significant in the India sample only and was stronger for boys.
The between-country differences correspond to what has been shown elsewhere, with Vietnamese children being better nourished on average than Indian children.
The choice of a community-level literacy variable, rather than an education variable, is based on the hypothesis that literacy is the key outcome of education and that the "externality" of education is spread mainly through literacy mechanisms.
The common approach of targeting women of reproductive age for health and nutrition interventions may overlook "influential others" in the family or community.
The concept of "mass education" was first introduced by Caldwel in 1980 and developed by Cleland and Jejeebhoy,who used survey data from south Asia to demonstrate that in communities.
The data from the first round of the Young Lives study are available from the UK Public Archive, study no. SN5307.
The data were recoded into the four main categories: "none", "primary" (corresponding to ages 6–11 years), "secondary" (11–14/15 years) or "higher" (15 years or above).
The difference in findings between India and Vietnam may be explained by differences in the cultural significance placed on the extended family or commune/community.
The effect is particularly strong for female education.
The impediment is our political unwillingness to implement the necessary economic reforms.
The literacy of other members of a "commune" can therefore realistically affect childcare through the sharing of knowledge and imitation of behaviour.
The mother's own health and physiological function can be substantially improved, leading to a greater capacity for work and feeling of general well-being.
The nutritional importance of breast-feeding needs to be stressed in all public health programmes, but so does the rational introduction of other forms of feeding.
The positive association between child nutrition and community-level maternal literacy in Vietnam, over and above parental education and other individual-level confounders and risk factors, suggests that children may benefit from living in literate communities.
The positive effect of maternal education is, nevertheless, not universal.
The prevalence of stunting and underweight was 19% and 24% in Vietnam and 28% and 43% in India.
The second implication is more novel: policies currently aimed at improving child nutrition may benefit from recognising and including key actors other than the mother.
The second implication is more novel: policies currently aimed at improving child nutrition may benefit from recognising key actors other than the mother.
The study also shows—in contrast to some other studies in the past—that fathers’ education is associated with child nutrition, and that this association was as strong as mothers’ education.
The study has demonstrated a positive association between child nutrition—both stunting and underweight—and the education of adults living within the child’s household and community.
There are two implications for nutrition policy emerging from this research.
There are two major policy implications from this research.
Therefore the findings support a call to widen the focus of nutrition policy and programmes from the mother–child pair towards the broader context of their family and community.
This is perhaps because increased pressure on women to work outside the home has had negative consequences for childcare and breastfeeding practices, which may have outweighed any potential benefit of education.
This research adds to the overwhelming evidence for a positive effect of adult education on child nutrition.
This study shows that children’s nutrition is associated with the education of many adult household and community members.
This study shows that mothers play a role in determining child nutrition, as well as fathers, grandmothers and the community at large.
This view is based on evidence spanning four decades for a positive effect of adult education on child health and nutrition in both developed and developing countries.
To examine independent effects of mothers’, fathers’ and grandmothers’ education on child height-for-age and weight-for-age z-score, and the role of community-level maternal literacy over and above parental education and other individual-level factors.
Unless the food intake of lactating mothers is exceptionally low, milk output seems to peak at about 750 ml/d.
A nutrition intervention programme should be evaluated in terms of improvement in nutritional status, but unfortunately success is difficult to identify using such criteria.
Acute malnutrition is still high by international standards.
Additional dietary education will be provided, paying special attention to regionally available food.
Again, depending on the region, vitamin status will be safeguarded by administering to the baby A, C or D, as appropriate.
Among children in developing countries, malnutrition is an important factor contributing to illness and death.
Among the other predictor variables included in the analysis, child’s age, child’s birth order, and household economic status all have independent effects on nutritional status.
Around six months, therapeutic iron will also be provided as needed.
Based on standards developed by WHO, 52 percent of children under age four are stunted, 17 percent are wasted, and 54 percent are underweight.
Between April 1992 and September 1993, the FHS collected information on all children under age four from a nationally representative sample of 88,562 households in 25 states (including Delhi, which became a state after the survey).
Between four and six months the provision of supplementary foods will be recommended, particularly to those who are low in weight.
Child malnutrition has long been recognized as a serious problem in India, but national-level data on levels and causes of malnutrition have been scarce.
Child malnutrition is considerably higher in rural areas than in urban areas.
Child malnutrition is generally caused by a combination of inadequate or inappropriate food intake, gastrointestinal parasites and other childhood diseases, and improper care during illness.
Children who fall more than three standard deviations below the reference median on any of these indices are defined as severely stunted, wasted, or underweight.
Children whose height-for-age falls more than two standard deviations below the reference median are defined as stunted.
Children whose mothers have completed middle school or higher education are even less likely to suffer malnutrition.
Children whose mothers have little or no education tend to have a lower nutritional status than do children of more-educated mothers.
Children whose mothers have some education but have not completed middle school are much less likely to be stunted, wasted, or underweight than are children whose mothers are illiterate.
Children with three or more older siblings are more likely to suffer chronic malnutrition than are children from smaller families, probably because competition for food increases with family size.
Children’s nutritional status varies widely by state.
Clear research evidence must come from many countries before supplementary feeding is condemned outright as being totally ineffective and hence of low priority.
Controlling for mother’s education and the other demographic and socioeconomic variables has virtually no effect on gender differences in any of the three indices of child malnutrition.
Decisions should, however, not be made merely on the number of beneficiaries; coverage cannot be the sole estimate of a programme's effectiveness, even if it does look good in the statistics book.
Depending on precise area needs, this dietary education will be supported by therapeutic iron and vitamin supplements.
Depending on the area and socio-economic level, complete weaning occurs between six and fourteen months of age.
Each index provides somewhat different information about a child’s nutritional status.
Efforts to improve child nutrition might usefully concentrate on states such as Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh where the problem is particularly severe.
Even in Kerala, which has the lowest infant and child mortality rates in India, more than one-fourth of young children are stunted, and similar proportions are underweight.
Family size does not have a significant effect on acute malnutrition, however, as indicated by wasting.
For pregnancy, a main consideration is dietary education regarding different mixtures of regional foods advisable for the pregnant mother.
For the 20 states where both height and weight were measured, the NFHS provides three indices of children’s nutritional status: height-for-age, weight-for-height, and weight-for-age.
For this reason, the independent effect of mother’s education is estimated here using logistic regression and multiple classification analysis to control for the effects of 12 other—potentially confounding—variables.
General education has also been shown to be an important factor.
Height-for-age measures linear growth retardation, primarily reflecting chronic (long-term) malnutrition.
In 1992– 93, the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) collected anthropometric data on the height and weight of children below four years of age from a nationally representative sample.
In 20 of these states, the survey collected information on children’s weight and height.
In Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal, only children’s weight was obtained because height-measuring boards were not available.
In Sri Lanka, after a decade of maternal supplementation, estimates of the incidence of low birth-weight remain unchanged.
In the analysis, these variables are held constant by setting them at their mean values.
In Sri Lanka Country-Wide Programme, for example, 75 per cent of mothers at risk were reached, but the success rate with children with second- and third-degree protein-energy malnutrition was only 50 per cent.
Infant and child mortality rates in these states are also higher than the national average.
Infants less than six months old are less likely to be malnourished than are older children, probably because they tend to be breastfed.
It could be concluded, therefore, that mothers were a better proposition.
It is considered in Sri Lanka, for example, that community involvement is crucial to the success of a government-sponsored programme.
Labour and delivery, to help you take care of your baby and get back in shape again.
Like family size, household economic status has a strong effect on chronic child malnutrition, shown by data on stunting and underweight, but no significant effect on acute malnutrition, indicated by wasting.
Likewise, current surveys of pre-school-child malnutrition do not show a change from a survey carried out in 1975/76.
Malnutrition during childhood can also affect growth potential and the risk of morbidity and mortality in later years of life.
Many suffer severe malnutrition, as defined by WHO standards.
Many young children in India are malnourished.
Mother’s education has a strong independent effect on a child’s nutritional status even after controlling for the potentially confounding effects of the 12 other demographic and socioeconomic variables.
None of the other variables analyzed has a strong, consistent, independent effect on the three measures of child malnutrition.
One common "leakage" of food aid identified in Sri Lanka was intra-familial, and perhaps the only practical approach is towards whole family units.
Other states with relatively high levels of child malnutrition are Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.
Other states with relatively low levels of malnutrition are Goa, Delhi, Manipur, Mizoram, and Nagaland.
Results indicate that more than half of all children under age four are malnourished.
Separate analyses of state-level data indicate that even in Bihar, where the status of women is arguably the lowest in India, malnutrition levels are similar for boys and girls.
Several different characteristics may influence a child’s nutritional status, confounding the effect of any single variable such as mother’s education.
Several other studies in India and in other developing countries with widespread sex discrimination have also failed to detect a gender differential in child malnutrition.
Some countries have assessed the viability of programmes by examining the effectiveness with which they have reached target groups.
Soysa has claimed that literacy is one of the main factors responsible for the reduction in birth-rates in Sri Lanka.
Soysa has postulated that one of the reasons why nutrition messages are not getting through to the rural areas is because of inadequate attempts to improve conventional methods of education.
Soysa has related the level of education of Sri Lankan women to their utilization of health services and has found a positive correlation.
Special attention will also be given to teaching hygiene to prepare the woman for her eventual motherhood.
Supportive education will also be carried out in schools and other governmental organizations.
Surprisingly, given widespread evidence of discrimination against girls in India, the proportions stunted and underweight are identical for boys and for girls.
Teaching sessions will be supported by posters and pamphlets.
Teaching will also be provided on how to integrate the child into the family diet.
The birth of your baby is one of the most exciting events in your life, a moment that you will cherish and remember always.
The comparatively low proportions of children wasted indicate that acute mal-nutrition is less common in India than chronic malnutrition.
The fourth session is done after delivery, which deals with postnatal exercises and getting back in shape.
The introduction of a specific nutritional programme directed at the mother and her child succeeds in focusing the attention of governments on a specific health issue in a way that more indirect ways, such as wage increases, never can.
The lower levels of wasting, compared with stunting and underweight, indicate that chronic (long-term) malnutrition is more common than acute (severe but short-term) malnutrition.
The prevalence of wasting among young children in India is about 8 times the level in the international reference population, and the prevalence of severe wasting is about 25 times the international level.
The proportion wasted is somewhat higher for boys.
The purpose of these Antenatal Care Sessions is to smoothen the process of labour and delivery, to provide answers to your questions about pregnancy, to ease the discomforts during pregnancy.
The states with the highest and lowest levels of malnutrition are Bihar and Kerala.
The survey provides a unique opportunity to study the levels and determinants of child malnutrition in India.
The third session is usually where I show a VCD of a labour and delivery and walk the patient through the entire process with husbands in attendance for this session.
There can, however, be positive achievements that are rarely taken into account.
These three indices are expressed in terms of standard deviations from the median for an international reference population specified by the World Health Organization (WHO).
This highlights the need for collaborative research of an applied nature between different developing countries.
This is a series of 4 sessions, which are individualized and start at 20 weeks with pelvic floor strengthening and aerobic exercises along with a nutrition and breast check.
This is an all-important factor politically and socially in shaping national policy.
This is followed by the next session at 26-28 weeks with stretching exercises and aerobic activities with a nutrition check.
This issue of the NFHS Bulletin estimates levels of child malnutrition and examines the effects of mother’s education and other demographic and socioeconomic factors on the nutritional status of children.
This lack of success is a common finding; Beaton and Ghassemi have recently reviewed a number of international programmes, and it was impossible to demonstrate a significant improvement in any of them.
This nutritional package for the mother and child will be backed by national educational measures via radio and television, and by a system for the distribution and sale of low-cost foods.
This would increase the cost of a food-aid programme, but no woman in any culture will restrict food to her own use; she will always share it with her family.
Thus, it might produce a better success rate if the whole family were aided, not just those clinically at risk.
Towards the end of pregnancy the importance of immediately breast-feeding the newborn will be stressed, plus the introduction of more adequate hygienic measures surrounding child-birth.
Twenty-nine percent are severely stunted, 3 percent are severely wasted, and 22 percent are severely underweight.
Weight-for-age reflects both chronic and acute malnutrition.
Weight-for-height measures bodymass in relation to height, primarily reflectingacute (short-term) malnutrition.
When developing countries have limited resources and there are competing demands for them, it is inevitable that there will be pressures to set priorities, with demonstrable success scoring highly.
When the baby is two months old the mother will be taught to prepare supplementary foods.
When the child reaches one year of age, he will be tested and treated for parasite infestation.
Why this is so is not easy to determine, but at least some of the blame must rest on logistic failures.
With all the complex social, economic, and political factors working against health improvements, it is not surprising that there is such a high apparent failure rate.
Women’s education and literacy programmes could play an important role in improving children’s nutritional status.
A baby does not need the nutrients in solid foods before age 4 to 6 months.
A baby exposed early to a flavour that appears in it's mother's milk will probably continue to enjoy that flavour when it appears in food.
A baby usually doubles its birth weight within the first 4 months and triples birth weight by the first birthday (cf. height and weight development).
Also, practice some comforting techniques, such as rocking your baby or talking or singing softly to her.
Although breast milk and formula contain very small amounts of vitamin C, it is enough to meet a baby's needs.
Although breastfeeding is best for most babies, this may not be possible for all families.
Although friends and relatives will share their experiences, the decision of how and when to feed your baby will depend on your baby's and your own needs.
Although malnutrition is highest among children of illiterate women, more than 40% of children whose mothers have completed middle school or higher education also suffer from chronic malnutrition.
Although most babies get fussy or appear colicky at times, it may be worth seeing if some type of food is causing it.
Among all the demographic and socioeconomic variables analyzed here, mother’s education has the strongest independent influence on child malnutrition.
An 8- to 9-month baby will have one or two teeth and can probably handle lumpy foods.
An emphasis on the states with the highest levels of child malnutrition should not preclude steps to improve child nutrition in other states
Around age 4 to 6 months, babies gain control of the head and can sit upright more easily.
As they grow, they will become more regular and will be able to go longer between feedings.
At 12 months the baby's stomach will be able to hold about 1 cup (225 grams/8 ounces).
At heavier weights, fluid needs are smaller. A 5½ kg/12 pound baby, for example, needs about 4 cups (1litre/1 quart) of fluid a day.
Babies get hungry at irregular times during the first few weeks.
Babies grow well in a variety of situations.
Babies have a strong sense of taste and do not need the flavour enhancers favourer by adults
Babies need about 1/3 cup of fluid per pound of body weight up to 8 kilograms/18 pounds.
Baby's main food will continue to be breast milk or formula.
Be careful not to give so much water that the baby fails to get enough milk.
Because babies can eat very little at one time, they eat every two or three hours.
Both of these developmental milestones show that a baby is ready to eat from a spoon.
Breast milk and commercial formulas contain adequate amounts of vitamins and minerals for normal infants.
By the second or third day, your baby needs calories, water, and nutrients.
By this time the baby will have doubled its birth weight and will be becoming hungrier.
Colic is a condition that affects some newborn infants.
Colic is a disorder where the infant displays intense crying and irritability for which there is no obvious cause.
Colic may be a result of something baby has eaten or something mother has eaten that appears in her milk.
Drinking plenty of water will help provide the needed liquid.
Each family must choose what best nutrition is for their babies.
Early experiences with food may have an impact on later eating habits.
Even in Kerala, the state with the lowest levels of child malnutrition in the country, more than one-fourth of all children under age four suffer from chronic malnutrition.
Even small babies can sense when a parent is tense rather than relaxed.
Feeding-on-demand has become more popular although some parents still prefer to set up regular schedules that are convenient for them and their babies.
Fluoride is known to be important for development of healthy teeth, but little research has been done to show how important fluoride is in the first six months of life.
For example, there is little iron in breast milk, but it is present in a very usable form.
For several decades parents were told to introduce solid foods early.
For this amazing growth, the infant requires an adequate intake of calories and essential nutrients.
Formula-fed babies will get adequate fluoride from the water (if it's fluoride-treated) that is mixed with the formula.
Full-term babies are usually born with enough reserves of nutrients, especially water, to last the first few days.
Generally the vitamins and minerals in breast milk are in forms that are especially well absorbed and used by an infant.
Give the baby a few days to get used to it before adding another.
Giving the baby extra vitamins and minerals is probably unnecessary under normal conditions and can be dangerous if excessive amounts are given.
Go easy. Start with easy-to-mash foods such as cooked potato or carrot, banana, or canned fruits.
Good nutrition alone will not guarantee normal development, but a loving environment is incomplete without proper feeding.
Hold your baby to let him know that this new experience is all right.
However, parents should be careful not to impose their taste preferences on the baby.
If any nutrient is going to be in short supply, it is iron.
If families with uneducated mothers or low socioeconomic status are more likely to misreport the ages of young children than are other families.
If you have not begun to do so, begin now to offer the baby foods prepared for the family.
If your baby cries soon after eating and you can discover no reason, try feeding a little water in a clean bottle (but make sure you boil then cool the water first).
If your baby starts to show some signs of chewing, you may want to give her some mashed vegetables or thick  cereal to work on to improve chewing skills.
In addition, a full-term baby from a well-nourished mother is born with iron stores large enough to last nearly six months.
In areas where the water is not fluoride-treated, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a fluoride supplement of 0.25 mg per day for both breastfed and bottle-fed babies.
In some cases babies were started on cereals as early as three weeks after birth.
Introduce only one new food at a time for your delicate baby.
Iron-fortified cereals are especially good sources of iron.
It is easy for parents to urge babies to eat more than they really want; most babies do not know how to resist.
It is most important for parents to make decisions that conditions are right for the family.
Just like older children and adults, babies need water as well as milk.
Many babies go through stages of inconsolable crying after feeding.
Many babies may want additional water, especially in hot weather.
Many paediatricians recognise this problem and recommend iron supplements.
Most of fluid should come from breast milk or formula.
Mothers’ exposure to electronic mass media has no statistically significant effect on levels of child malnutrition.
New mothers who want to return to work have often been able to combine breastfeeding with formula-feeding, especially after the first few weeks, when the milk supply has been well established.
One study suggests that breastfed infants are more likely to try new flavours later in life.
Over 40 different nutrients are needed by your baby for healthy growth and development.
Research shows that flavours from the food mother have eaten appear in her milk.
Rice is less likely to cause allergic reactions than other grains.
Solid food gives your baby a good source of iron, as well as a good distribution of calories between carbohydrates, protein, and fat.
Some children below age four were reported as older than they really were.
Some paediatricians and nutritionists believe that early introduction of solid foods teaches a baby to overeat.
Some paediatricians recommend iron-fortified infant rice cereal mixed with breast milk or formula as a first solid food.
Supplementation should begin two weeks after birth.
The analysis shows that young children in small families are less likely to suffer chronic malnutrition than are children with three or more older siblings.
The baby should be nestled close, touched, rocked, and talked to during feeding times.
The current recommendation is to wait until the baby is 4 to 6 months old.
The first year of life is a time of more rapid growth and development than any other time of life.
The nursing mother usually needs extra 500 kilocalories per day, along with 20 more grams of protein and 400 more milligrams of calcium.
The results of this analysis add emphasis to the many other arguments in favor of strengthening women’s education and literacy programmes in India.
The stomach of a newborn infant has a capacity of less than ¼ cup.
These daily fluids are necessary for the formation of urine to help remove wastes from the body.
These findings should be interpreted with a degree of caution because there is evidence for some age misreporting in the survey.
This can be supplied by adding a glass of milk, a slightly larger serving of meat, and an egg or a slice of bread.
This finding provides a strong justification for family planning programs to limit family size.
This is useful in sucking but prevents a baby from moving solid foods from the front of the mouth backward for swallowing.
This means that estimates of stunting and underweight, which are based on height-for-age and weight-for-age, may exaggerate the extent of malnutrition.
This suggests that efforts to improve women’s education need to be combined with more specific programmes to improve child-feeding practices.
This suggests that radio and television programming in India needs to include more—or more effective—messages on children’s nutritional requirements.
Until the age of three months, babies have a natural reflex to push outward with the tongue.
Vegetables and fruits follow cereals at around 7 months.
Whichever feeding method is chosen, the baby needs to be fed in an atmosphere of love.
Without this tender physical contact, babies often fail to grow and develop.
Your baby may need reassuring when you first introduce solid foods.
Your baby needs the same nutrients you do: protein, carbohydrate, fat, water, vitamins, and minerals.
Your baby's nutritional needs will be safely and adequately supplied whether you choose to breast-feed or use commercial infant formula.
A baby who continues to drink large amounts of milk may not be eating enough solid foods to meet his or her increasing nutritional needs.
A total weight gain of about 25 to 30 pounds is usually recommended, with the actual pattern of gain considered more important than the number of pounds.
A woman who breast-feeds expends 600 to 800 more calories than one who doesn't.
According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, pregnant women should increase their usual servings of a variety of foods.
Adolescents and black women, who often have smaller babies, are now strongly advised to gain a greater amount.
Although egg yolks can be added to the diet around 10 months, egg whites or whole eggs should not be given to your baby until the end of the first year.
Although meat is a good source of protein, most babies get plenty of protein from milk.
Although the extra nutrients are required, an increase of only 300 calories per day is recommended.
Approximately 6 to 8 pounds of the total weight is the baby, and the remaining weight consists of an increased fluid volume, larger breasts and uterus, amniotic fluid, and placenta.
Around 10 to 12 months, eggs can be added to the diet.
As a baby learns to drink more milk from the cup, bottles or breast feedings can be discontinued gradually.
At this stage, a finger food is anything soft that holds together long enough for baby to get it from plate to mouth.
Babies accept room temperature and cold food, so warming is not really necessary.
Babies and parents who are satisfied with breast milk or commercial formula may continue to use either one until 12 months.
Babies are generally weaned by the end of the first year.
Based on a 1990 study, IOM now recommends a weight gain of 25 to 35 pounds during a normal pregnancy to decrease this risk.
Beets and spinach have high concentrations of naturally-occurring nitrates that can reduce the ability of the baby's haemoglobin to transport oxygen.
Beets and spinach should be used in moderation or not at all until the baby reaches his first birthday.
Besides, babies need calories for growth and development.
Breast-feeding helps to deplete the fat deposited during pregnancy.
By 10 months your baby is probably eating and enjoying a variety of cereals, vegetables, and fruits.
By the age of 1 year a baby should be eating a variety of foods and drinking only about 2 cups of milk a day.
Care must be taken when using a microwave oven to heat baby food.
Changes in nutritional needs in pregnancy appear to be related to the body's adaptation to pregnancy because the changes occur too early to be responding solely to fetal needs.
Cheese and yoghurt in small amounts may be added to the diet now.

Further, sodium deprivation may be harmful to the fetus.
Government Benefit Programs website can help you find government programs for which you and your child qualify.
Honey is not recommended for infants under the age of 12 months because it may carry botulism spores.
However, the IOM panel found insufficient evidence to recommend that all women take supplements containing folate, which can be found in liver, kidneys, leafy green vegetables, and dried beans and peas.
However, there is not universal agreement on the necessity of folate supplements for all pregnant women.
If a woman's calorie intake is restricted in pregnancy, she may not get enough protein, vitamins and minerals to adequately nourish her unborn child.
If they take the place of nutritious foods and beverages, they can be harmful.
If you do warm in a microwave oven, use extreme caution, and stir the food well before feeding baby to ensure the food is at an even temperature.
In certain studies, the vitamin folic acid has been shown to be important in preventing neural tube defects , such as spina bifida.
Iron is needed in larger doses, especially in the later stages of pregnancy, and cannot be met by diet alone, according to the National Research Council.
Low-calorie intake can result in a breakdown of stored fat in the mother, leading to the production of substances called ketones in her blood and urine.
Medicaid in each state can help you with answers about free services offered to you and your child.
Microwaves can heat a food unevenly, forming hot-spots.
More iron is needed not only because of fetal demands, but also because the mother's blood volume may be increased as much as 30 percent.
Most health and child care professionals recommend against using a microwave oven to warm baby food.
Most physicians agree that RDAs, except those for iron, can be obtained through a proper diet.
Most women lose this extra weight in the birth process or within several weeks thereafter.
Not all honey contains botulism spores, but because babies do not need honey, there is no reason to take the risk.
NutraSweet(TM) is considered safe in moderate amounts for children and adults, but safety for babies is not yet fully established.
Obstetricians will continue to make the decision to recommend supplements based on individual requirements and will not recommend multivitamin supplements without a specific medical reason.
Often, nutritional supplements are provided for pregnant women, but according to a June 1990 report released by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) studies found these supplements to be of little or no value.
Once your baby begins to be able to take hold of things, you may offer finger foods that will help develop co-ordination.
One spoonful of the food may be cold, yet the next spoonful could burn the baby's mouth.
Other No-No foods for babies include desserts, carbonated beverages, caffeine-containing beverages, and candy.
Powered soft drink mixes sweetened with sugar or NutraSweet(TM) are not good for babies.
Pregnancy doubles a woman's need for folate (folic acid or folacin).
Pregnant women require different amounts of iron, folic acid, sodium, and sugar intake.
Raw Eggs and Raw Milk are not appropriate for babies.
Raw Eggs and Raw Milk may be sources of infections that can be dangerous to infants.
Rusks make a good finger food when baby starts teething.
Studies have since shown that underweight women, or those who gain fewer than 20 pounds during pregnancy, are at an increased risk of delivering low-birth-weight babies.
Such changes are partly due to the nourishment demands of the fetus and partly to other physiological variations that affect absorption and metabolism of nutrients.
Such changes include a reduction of electrolytes, proteins, glucose, vitamin B-12, folate, vitamin B-6, and a rise in lipids, triglycerides, and cholesterol in blood.
Sugar is also an occasional concern in pregnancy.
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is an organization of doctors who specialize in baby and child care.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends 3 to 4 pounds in the first three months and 3 to 4 pounds per month during the rest of the pregnancy.
The consequences of maternal malnourishment may include health problems for the mother and an infant of low birth weight who may have nutritional and other deficiencies.
The digestive system of children and adults can destroy these harmful spores but a baby cannot.
The Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences specifies certain increases in the Recommended Daily Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for pregnant and lactating women.
The most important contribution meat can make to a baby's diet is iron.
The National Academy of Sciences recommends that pregnant women eat an average of 150 calories more per day in the first trimester and 350 calories more per day in the two subsequent trimesters than they did before becoming pregnant.
The need for folic acid is essential to the formation of red blood cells.
The production of ketones is a sign of starvation of a starvation-like state.
The recommended increase in weight gain does not give a green light for mothers-to-be to overeat.
The sodium intake usually recommended in pregnancy is 2,000 to 8,000 milligrams a day, compared to the normally recommended 1,100 to 3,300 milligrams per day.
The spores may remain active in the stomach and produce their deadly toxin.
The use of breast milk or commercial formula until 12 months is recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
The woman who nurses her baby also has increased needs for specific nutrients.
There are numerous changes in nutritional needs for a pregnant woman.
There is considerable medical opinion that pregnancy is a "salt-wasting" condition, that is, one in which the body can use more salt than usual.
These changes help insure normal development of the baby and fill the subsequent demands of lactation, or nursing (breastfeeding).
Thirty years ago, the National Research Council's Food and Nutrition Board advised women to gain 20 to 25 pounds during pregnancy.
This is because egg whites often cause allergic reactions if introduced too early.
This mineral is essential to the formation of healthy red blood cells, and it is difficult for a woman to consume enough of it from foods to maintain an adequate supply for herself and her fetus.
Until the age of six months, babies need either breast milk or commercial formula as their main source of nutrients even though babies will begin to eat other foods.
Virtually all women excrete more glucose (a form of sugar) in their urine when they are pregnant.
We know that the health of your child is of the utmost importance to you and so we have provided the following information and links to help insure that your child gets the best possible medical care.
Weight gain during pregnancy should be gradual.
Weight gain should be at its lowest during the first trimester, and should steadily increase, with the mother-to-be gaining the most weight in her third trimester, when the fetus and placenta are growing the most.
While research continues, the IOM recommends supplements only for pregnant women who are smokers, drug users, alcohol drinkers, or strict vegetarians.
WIC provides free food, nutrition counseling, and referrals at no charge.
Without enough iron, the fetus will draw its supply from the mother, often leaving her anemic and exhausted.
A point, however, which has not been sufficiently emphasized is that for a given deficit the risk is much greater for younger children.
About 60 per cent of births in the developing world are attended by skilled health personnel.
About 69 percent of children with suspected pneumonia are taken to a health facility and 13 percent are treated with antibiotics.
About 75 per cent of under five deaths in India are infant deaths and about half of U5 children die within four weeks of their birth.
About one-third of underweight children under age five in the world live in India.
Although India has made progress in the reduction of child mortality, the average annual rate of reduction in U5 mortality between 1990 and 2006 has been 2.6 per cent.
An estimated 21 thousand children are infected each year through mother to child transmission.
An estimated 70 thousand children below age 15 are infected with HIV.
Approximately 61 percent of men and women used condoms during high risk sexual activity.
Around 2 million children under five die from the disease every year – around one in every five children globally.
Around 51 million children born in 2006 have not been registered, of which about 9 million are in India.
Average annual rate of decline since 1990 has been 0.9 per cent – accelerated progress is needed to meet the MDG target.
Between 1990 and 2004, South Asia and India more than doubled their coverage in improved sanitation.
But with only 225 cases of polio reported in 2003, India is well on its way to interrupting transmission and eradicating the disease.
Children in India continue to lose their life to vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, which remains the biggest killer.
Considering that 6-10 is the primary school age in India, 84 per cent of children are attending school.
Despite health improvements over the last thirty years, lives continue to be lost to early childhood diseases, inadequate newborn care and childbirth-related causes.
Each year, around 4 million children die within the first 28 days of life – the newborn (neo-natal) period.
Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life has the potential to avert 13 per cent of all under-five deaths in developing countries.
Existing studies show that over 40 per cent of women sex workers enter into prostitution before the age of 18 years.
Globally 158 million children age 5-14 are engaged in labour.
Globally diarrhoea is the second largest killer and accounts for approximately 2 million deaths among children under five.
Globally the gender parity index of 1.0 for primary school attendance ratio is likely to be achieved.
Globally the number of children out of school has declined significantly – from 115 million in 2002 to 93 million in 2005-06.
Globally the world is on track to meet the MDG on safe drinking water.
Globally, 33.2 million people (2.4 million children) are living with HIV.
Hemorrhage accounts for about 38 per cent of total maternal deaths in India.
However parity in secondary education is still a challenge - for 100 boys in secondary school, there are only 80 girls in school.
However, the proportion of children who receive vaccination against measles has dropped considerably, from 72% in 1995 to a low of 50% in 1999. It now stands at 61%.
If India is to reach the MDG Goal of 38 by 2015, the average annual rate of reduction in the next nine years has to be about 7.6 per cent.
In 2004, 2.4 billion persons globally did not use sanitation facilities.
In 2005-06 in India, 39 percent of children suffering from diarrhoea received ORT (Oral Rehydration Therapy).
In 2006, for the first time, the number of children in the world dying before their fifth birthday fell below 10 million, to 9.7 million.
In addition, only 15 per cent of mothers receive complete antenatal care and only 58 per cent receive iron or folate tablets or syrup.
In India 23 per cent of children are initiated with breastfeeding within one hour of birth.
In India 46 per cent of children are exclusively breastfed vs. 38 per cent in the developing world and 45 per cent in South Asia.
In India in 2005-06 an estimated 22 million women aged 20-24 years reported they were married before the age of 18.
In India the underweight prevalence rate is 43 per cent.
In India, 23.8 percent women and 32.6 percent men displayed comprehensive knowledge about HIV / AIDS.
In India, children’s vulnerabilities and exposure to violations of their protection rights remain spread and multiple in nature.
In India, the percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel stood at 47 per cent.
In India, there is an improvement in measles immunization coverage - however it is still below 60 per cent.
In India, this number is estimated to be about one million, which means a quarter of all neo-natal deaths in the world occur in India.
In states like Bihar, Mizoram, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, 60 per cent or more girls dropped out before completing their five years primary education.
India accounts for 18 percent of the world’s burden which is approximately 29 million.
India has the largest number of pneumonia deaths.
India has the largest pool of never immunized children in the world – 9.4 million. Of the 26 million children not immunized with DPT 3 globally, 11.5 million live in India.
India is on track to achieve parity in primary education - for 100 boys in primary school, there are 96 girls in school.
India therefore contributes to about 21 per cent of the global burden of child deaths.
India too is on track with 84.5 percent rural and 95 percent urban populations having sustainable access to safe drinking water.
India’s ratio in 2005 is estimated to be 450 (adjusted UN estimate) and is classified in ‘High’ category.
Infant mortality in India is as high as 63 deaths per 1,000 live births.
Malnutrition is the underlying cause in up to 50 per cent under-five deaths.
Measles is one of the leading causes of vaccine-preventable child mortality.
More than two million children die every year from preventable infections.
Moreover, for children who have been trafficked and rescued, opportunities for rehabilitation remain scarce and reintegration process arduous.
Most infant deaths occur in the first month of life; up to 47 per cent in the first week itself.
One of the cost effective and feasible interventions to improve the situation includes initiating breastfeeding within one hour of birth.
Out of the 500,000 maternal deaths in the developing world, approximately 23 per cent are in India.
Pneumonia kills more children than any other illness – more than AIDS, malaria and measles combined.
Prevent newborn deaths through home-based medical visits.
Progress has been incremental from 42 per cent (1998/99).
Proper infant feeding practices are key to child survival.
Safe and clean drinking water is essential for child survival.
Skilled attendance at delivery is critical to reducing maternal deaths.
South Asia contributed to 3.1 million of under five deaths and India, 2.1 million.
Strengthen existing health systems by increasing the number of health workers.
Tetanus in newborns remains a problem in at least five states: Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, West Bengal, and Assam.
The global Maternal Mortality Ratio (2005) is estimated at 400 per 100,000 live births.
The lack of available services, as well as the gaps persisting in law enforcement and in rehabilitation schemes also constitute a major cause of concern.
The manifestations of these violations are various, ranging from child labour, child trafficking, to commercial sexual exploitation and many other forms of violence and abuse.
The nature and scope of trafficking range from industrial and domestic labour, to forced early marriages and commercial sexual exploitation.
The NFHS 3 data (2005-06) reveals that 45 percent of households in the country use improved sanitation facilities.
The number of people living with HIV /AIDS in India is estimated to be 2-3.1 million.
The number of polio cases in India declined from 1,934 in 1998 to 268 in 2001.
The percentage of children age 6-9 months in the developing world who are given complementary food is 56 per cent - the corresponding figure for India is 57 per cent.
The prevalence of wasting in India is about 20 per cent, requiring urgent response.
The reasons for this high mortality are that few women have access to skilled birth attendants and fewer still to quality emergency obstetric care.
The states with the highest number of children underweight are Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar, followed by Gujarat, Orissa, Chattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Meghalaya.
The under five mortality rate (U5MR) for India in 2006 has been estimated as 76.
The WFFC target for reducing 50 per cent mortality has been achieved.
There are 24 developing countries with wasting rates of 10 per cent or more.
There has been remarkable progress in measles immunization worldwide particularly in developing countries.
There was a setback in 2002 as 1,600 cases were confirmed at the end of the year.
Timely and appropriate complementary feeding could avert a further six per cent of under-five deaths.
Trafficking of children also continues to be a serious problem in India.
U5 mortality is usually the result of acute significant food shortage and / or disease.
While a number of middle-income countries have made progress in reducing maternal mortality deaths, less progress has been achieved in Sub-Saharan Africa.
While systematic data and information on child protection issues are still not always available, evidence suggests that children in need of special protection belong to communities suffering disadvantage and social exclusion such as scheduled casts and tribes, and the poor.
While the Infant Mortality Rate showed a rapid decline during the 1980s, the decrease has slowed during the past decade.
With an estimated 12.6 million children engaged in hazardous occupations (2001 Census), for instance, India has the largest number of child labourers under the age of 14 in the world.
Worldwide 37 per cent of under-five deaths are attributed to neo-natal causes.
Worldwide more than 60 million women aged 20-24 were married before the age of 18.
Worldwide, the lack of sanitation, poor hygiene and unsafe drinking water contribute to more than 1.5 million child deaths each year from diarrhoeal diseases.
Yet in 2004, an estimated 700 million people in India were not using improved sanitation facilities.
A mother’s death is a tragedy unlike others, because of the deeply held feeling that no one should die in the course of the normal process of reproduction and because of the devasta-ting effects on her family.
An increasing number of countries have succeeded in improving the health and well-being of mothers, babies and children in recent years, with noticeable results.
As 28% of child deaths still occur in South-East Asia, two of the six WHO regions - Africa and South-East Asia - account for more than 70% of all child deaths.
As a result, all industrialized countries and their colonies, as well as Thailand and many Latin American countries, had instituted at least an embryonic form of maternal and infant health services by the onset of the 20th century.
As more and more thousands of men were slaughtered every day, the belligerent nations, on whatever side, began to see that new human lives, which could grow up to replace brutally extinguished adult lives, were extremely valuable national assets.
Backed by large numbers of official reports, maternal and child health became a priority for ministries of health.
Because of this, society values the health of its mothers and children for its own sake and not merely as a contribution to the wealth of the nation.
Being healthy means much more than merely surviving.
Between 1970 and 1990, the under-five mortality rate dropped by 20% every decade; between 1990 and 2000 it dropped by only 12%.
By the 1950s, national health plans and policy documents from development agencies invariably stressed that mothers and children were vulnerable groups and therefore priority “targets” for public health action.
Caring for the health of mothers and children soon gained a legitimacy of its own, beyond military and economic calculations.
Child deaths are increasingly concentrated in the African Region (43% of the global total in 2003, up from 30% in 1990).
First, children are the future of society, and their mothers are guardians of that future.
For centuries, care for childbirth and young children was regarded as a domestic affair, the realm of mothers and midwives.
For governments that take their function of reducing inequality and redistributing wealth seriously, improving the living conditions and providing access to health care for mothers and children are good starting points.
Global events precipitated public interest in the roles and responsibilities of governments, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 by the newly formed United Nations.
Globally, we are making progress towards the MDGs in maternal and child health.
Governments saw a possible solution in the pioneering French experiments of the 1890s.
Healthy mothers and children were seen by governments at that time to be a resource for economic and political ambitions.
However, the countries with the highest burden of mortality and ill-health to start with made little progress during the 1990s.
If further progress is to be made in reducing child mortality, increased efforts are needed to bring about a substantial reduction in deaths among newborns.
Improving health is a condition for poverty alleviation and for development.
Improving their health is at the core of the world’s push to reduce poverty and inequality.
In 1938 the Mothers’ Charter was proclaimed by 60 local associations in the United Kingdom.
In all cultures, families and communities acknowledge the need to care for mothers and children and try to do so to the best of their ability.
In contrast, progress continued or accelerated in the WHO Region of the Americas, and the South-East Asia and European Regions.
In practice, child health programmes were usually the central - often the only - programmatic content of early attempts to implement primary health care.
In some, the situation has actually worsened in recent years.
In the 20th century, the health of mothers and children was transformed from a purely domestic concern into a public health priority with corresponding responsibilities for the state.
In the opening years of the 21st century, the Millennium Development Goals place it at the core of the struggle against poverty and inequality, as a matter of human rights.
In this more politicized view, women’s relative lack of decision-making power and their unequal access to employment, finances, education, basic health care and other resources are considered to be the root causes of their ill-health.
In too many countries the health of mothers and children is not making the progress it should.
It is no accident that the formulation of the MDG targets and indicators reveals the special priority given to the health and well-being of women, mothers and children.
It may seem like a cold-blooded thing to say, but someone ought to point out that the World War was a back-handed break for children.
Looking at it another way, more than 50% of all child deaths are concentrated in just six countries: China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and Pakistan.
Many of Europe’s politicians shared a perception that the ill-health of the nation’s children threatened their cultural and military aspirations.
Maternal and child health programmes became a public health paradigm alongside that of the battle against infectious diseases.
Millions of women and their families live in a social environment that works against seeking and enjoying good health.
Most of the millions of untimely deaths that occur are avoidable, as is much of the suffering that comes with ill-health.
Most pregnant women hope to give birth safely to a baby that is alive and well and to see it grow up in good health.
Mother and child health is clearly on the international agenda even in the absence of universal access to reproductive health services as a specific Millennium Development Goal.
Mothers are much more than caregivers and homemakers, undervalued as these roles often are.
Mothers influence early behaviour and establish lifestyle patterns that not only determine their children’s future development and capacity for health, but shape societies.
Nevertheless, children across southern and central Asia continue to suffer very high levels of malnutrition.
Nevertheless, the mortality rates of children under five years of age provide a good indicator of the progress made - or the tragic lack of it.
One of the core functions assigned to the World Health Organization (WHO) in its Constitution of 1948 was “to promote maternal and child health and welfare”.
Overall, children today are better nourished: between 1990 and 2000 the global prevalence of stunting and underweight declined by 20% and 18%, respectively.
Poor nutrition in girls, early onset of sexual activity and adolescent pregnancy all have consequences for well-being during and after pregnancy for both mothers and children.
Poverty, cultural traditions and legal barriers restrict their access to financial resources, making it even more difficult to seek health care for themselves or for their children.
Progress has therefore been patchy and unless it is accelerated significantly, there is little hope of reducing maternal mortality by three quarters and child mortality by two thirds by the target date of 2015 - the targets set by the Millennium Declaration.
Second, few consequences of the inequities in society are as damaging as those that affect the health and survival of women and children.
Set out eight specific Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), each with its numerical targets and indicators for monitoring progress.
Success is overshadowed, however, by the persistence of an unacceptably high mortality and the increasing inequity in maternal and child health and access to health care worldwide.
Sustainable improvement of health depends on successful poverty alleviation and reduction of inequalities.
The 1987 Call to Action for Safe Motherhood explicitly framed it as “deeply rooted in the adverse social, cultural and economic environments of society, and especially the environment that societies create for women”.
The African Region started out at the highest levels, saw the smallest reductions (around 5% by decade between 1980 and 2000) and the most marked slowing down.
The conference produced a 20-year plan of action that focused on universal access to reproductive health services (of which maternal and child health care became a subset), which was grounded in individual choices and rights.
The creation of public health programmes to improve the health of women and children has its origins in Europe at the end of the nineteenth century.
The destructive influence of HIV/AIDS - but also the failure to translate life-saving knowledge into effective action and to invest adequately in public health and a safe environment.
The early implementation of primary health care often had a narrow focus, but among its merits was the fact that it laid the groundwork for linking health to development and to a wider civil society debate on inequalities.
The fortunes of the world’s children have also been mixed in terms of their nutritional status.
The global averages also hide important regional differences.
The health agenda emphasis on health reflects a global consensus that ill-health is an important dimension of poverty in its own right. Ill-health contributes to poverty.
The health agenda is explicit in three of the eight goals, eight of the 18 targets, and 18 of the 48 indicators.
The health of mothers and children satisfies the classical criteria for setting public health priorities.
The increasing involvement of a variety of authorities - medical and lay, charitable and governmental - resonated with the rising expectations and political activism of civil society.
The International Labour Organization proposed legal standards for the protection of maternity at work in 1919.
The New York Times published articles on maternal mortality in the early 1930.
The notion of mothers and children as vulnerable groups was also central to the primary health care movement launched at Alma-Ata (now Almaty, Kazakhstan) in 1978.
The plight of mothers and children soon came to be seen as much more than a problem of biological vulnerability.
The programmes also increasingly found support in the emerging social reform and charitable movements of the time.
The rate was “only” 4.3 times higher in 1980 and 5.4 times higher in 1990.
The reasons for this are complex and vary from one country to another.
The result is that the differences between regions are growing.
The shift to a concern for the rights of women and children was accelerated by the International Conference on Population and Development, held in Cairo, Egypt, in 1994.
The slowing down of progress started in the 1980s in the WHO African and Western Pacific Regions, and during the 1990s in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.
The ugliest way - and, I suspect, the truer - is to say flatly that it was the military usefulness of human life that brought the change.
The under-five mortality rate is now seven times higher in the African Region than in the European Region.
The unfairness of this situation has made it obvious that the health of mothers and children is an issue of rights, entitlements and day-to-day struggle to secure these entitlements.
Their chances of doing so are better in 2005 than ever before - not least because they are becoming aware of their rights.
These programmes offered a scientific and convincing way to produce healthy children who would become productive workers and robust soldiers.
These programmes really started to gain ground after the Second World War.
They include the familiar, persistent enemies of health - poverty, inequality, war and civil unrest.
They may be reluctant to use health services where they feel threatened and humiliated by the staff, or pressured to accept treatments that conflict with their own values and customs.
They may have no say in decisions on whether to use contraception or where to give birth.
They transmit the cultural history of families and communities along with social norms and traditions.
This change in perspective is important, because it alters the rationale for investing in the health of mothers and children.
This feeling was particularly strong in France and Britain, which had experienced difficulties in recruiting soldiers fit enough for war.
This first major attempt at massive scaling up of health care coverage in rural areas boosted maternal and child health programmes by its focus on initiatives to increase immunization coverage.
This knowledge makes investment more successful and withholding care even less acceptable.
This leaves many mothers and children, particularly the poorest among them, excluded from access to the affordable, effective and responsive care to which they are entitled.
This shift in emphasis has far-reaching consequences for the way the world responds to the very uneven progress in different countries.
Throughout sub-Saharan Africa the numbers of children who are stunted and underweight increased in this period.
Today, more is known than ever before about what determines the health of women and children and about which interventions bring about improvements most cost- effectively.
Towards the turn of the millennium, however, the overall downward trend was showing signs of slowing.
Under-five mortality rates fell worldwide throughout the latter part of the 20th century.
With today’s knowledge and technology, the vast majority of the problems that threaten the world’s mothers and children can be prevented or treated.
Women often have limited exposure to the education, information and new ideas that could spare them from repeated childbearing and save their lives during childbirth.
Workers’ movements, women’s groups, charities and professional organizations took up the cause of the health of women and children in many different ways.
“Special care and assistance” added an international and moral dimension to the issue of the health of mothers and children, representing a huge step forward from the political and economic concerns of 50 years earlier.
529 000 die each year (including 68 000 as a result of an unsafe abortion), leaving behind children who are more likely to die because they are motherless.
98% of newborn deaths occur in developing countries.
A few countries such as Bolivia and Egypt have managed this in more recent years.
A total of 93 countries, including most of those in the high income bracket, are “on track” to reduce their 1990 under-five mortality rates by two thirds by 2015 or sooner.
Although trend data are not available, neonatal and maternal mortality is highest in the countries with reversal and stagnation in under-five mortality.
As a parent, I understand the overwhelming pressures to feed children sugary snacks and fast-food meals.
As most progress is being made in countries that already have relatively low levels of maternal and child deaths, while the worst-off stagnate, the gaps between countries are inevitably widening.
As the situation improves at a slower pace than expected - and hoped for - the gains in avoided deaths are partially offset by the demographic momentum.
Be patient, take your cues from your baby, and in no time at all, your baby will be sleeping.
because where a mother gets no or inadequate care during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period, this is usually also the case for her newborn baby.
Both live births and deaths of newborns go underreported.
Both mothers and newborns have a better chance of survival if they have skilled help at birth.
Cause of death is routinely reported for only 100 countries of the world, covering one third of the world’s population.
Children are also more likely to eat a lot of fruits, juices, fruit bars, etc.
Children's foods are often concentrated (water is extracted from baby-food for example) thus concentrating chemical residue.
Countries that show reversal or stagnation are overwhelmingly in the African Region.
Data on stillbirths are even more scarce than those on newborn deaths.
Disease and disability among women of reproductive age in developing countries - more than any other single health problem..
During the 1960s and 1970s, some countries did reduce their maternal mortality by half over a period of 10 years or less.
During the 1990s there were more such countries than during the two previous decades combined.
Each year, about four million newborns die before they are four weeks old.
Effectively, this leaves no record of the fate of 36 million - about 1 out of 4 - of the women who give birth every year.
Eventually these steps will take over for nursing or bottle-feeding, and then they too will fade away, and your baby will be sleeping longer.
Fast food restaurants will often use an hydrogenated oil for deep-frying.
Fetal deaths are even more likely to go unreported, particularly early fetal deaths.
Finally, there are 14 “reversal” countries, where under-five mortality rates went down to an average of 111 in 1990 but have increased since.
First, because healthier mothers have healthier babies.
For 62 developing countries, including most of those with very high levels of mortality, the only existing estimates are based on statistical modelling.
For every newborn baby who dies, at least another 20 suffer birth injury, infection, complications of preterm birth and other neonatal conditions.
Gradual improvements in data availability, however, mean that a growing database now exists of maternal mortality by country.
He’s done things this way since the day he was born, and he’d be perfectly happy to keep things as they are.
If further progress is to be made in reducing child mortality, increased efforts are needed to bring about a substantial reduction in deaths among newborns.
In the late 1970s, less than one developing country in three was able to provide data - and these were usually only partial hospital statistics.
Information on maternal mortality remains a serious problem.
It has not been possible, though, to assess changes over time with any confidence.
It is even difficult to obtain reliable survey data that are nationally representative.
Keep in mind that your baby’s seeming inability to fall asleep on his own is not his fault.
Less than 1% of deaths occur in high-income countries.
Manufacturers often use a variety of ‘sugars’, thus reducing the individual ingrediant weights.
Many farm chemicals are tested and approved for 150 pound males, not children.
Maternal mortality is highest by far in sub-Saharan Africa, where the lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 16, compared with 1 in 2800 in rich countries.
More problematic are the 29 countries where mortality rates are “stagnating”.
More rigorous estimates became available for 1995 and for 2000.
Most of the live birth increase will be in sub-Saharan Africa and in parts of Asia - Pakistan and northern India.
Neonatal mortality is now 6.5 times lower in the high-income countries than in other countries.
Nevertheless, there is a sense of progress, backed by the tracking of indicators that point to significant increases in the uptake of care during pregnancy and childbirth in all regions except sub-Saharan Africa during the 1990s.
Newborn deaths now contribute to about 40% of all deaths in children under five years of age globally, and more than half of infant mortality.
Over 300 million women in the developing world currently suffer from short-term or long-term illness brought about by pregnancy and childbirth.
over a million children who survive birth asphyxia each year develop problems such as cerebral palsy, learning difficulties and other disabilities.
Pregnancy and childbirth and their consequences are still the leading causes of death.
Progress has slowed down and is increasingly uneven, with a widening gap between rich and poor countries as well as, often, between the poor and the rich within countries.
Rates of newborn deaths are highest in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.
Recent success stories in maternal health are less often heard than those for child health.
Refined grains (white bread, pasta, rice etc.) and sugar contain little to no nutrition.
Since 1990, a joint working group of WHO, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has been regularly assessing and synthesizing the available information.
Since professional care is known to be crucial in averting maternal deaths as well as in improving maternal health, maternal mortality ratios are likely to be declining everywhere except for those countries which started the 1990s at high levels.
So no global downturn in maternal mortality ratios can yet be asserted.
Sugar seriously depletes white blood cell capabilities for up to five hours after ingestion, thus limiting your child's body's ability to fight off viruses or bacteria it comes into contact with.
Sugar stimulates LPL (lipoprotein lipase) which encourages the body to store food as fat.
TFAs are linked to cancer and heart disease in children and are known to suppress the immune system.
TFAs interfere with enzyme functioning, liver detoxification, and essential fatty acid metabolization.
The above figures do not include the 3.3 million stillbirths per year.
The countries that rely on these modelled estimates represent 27% of the world’s births.
The first global estimates of neonatal mortality, dating from 1983.
The gap between rich and poor countries is widening.
The health and survival of newborn children is closely linked to that of their mothers.
The lifetime risk for a woman to lose a newborn baby is now 1 in 5 in Africa, compared with 1 in 125 in more developed countries.
The new estimates show that the burden of newborn mortality is considerably higher than many people realize.
The number of deaths among children under five years of age is going down and the mortality rates are dropping, but not fast enough to reach one third of their 1990 level by 2015, unless they significantly accelerate progress during the coming 10 years.
The numbers of untimely deaths of mothers and children could well be on the increase, because while rates are dropping, the numbers of mothers, births and children continue to grow.
The on-track countries are those that already had the lowest rates in 1990 (taken together they had a rate of 59 in 1990).
The proportion of births assisted by a skilled attendant rose by 24% during the 1990s, caesarean sections tripled and antenatal care use rose by 21%.
The situation has now improved but births and deaths in developing countries are often only registered for small portions of the population except in some Asian and Latin American countries.
The slowing down of improvement of global indicators that so worries policy-makers hides a patchwork of countries that are on track, show slow progress, are stagnating or are going into reverse.
The uncertainty associated with maternal mortality estimates makes it difficult to say whether that mortality has gone up or down.
Their families are usually unprepared for such tragedies and are profoundly affected.
Then your concerns will turn to the next phase in this magnificent, challenging, and ultimately rewarding experience we call parenthood.
There have been few signs of global improvement in this situation.
These are areas where the protection of adolescents and young women against early or unwanted pregnancy is most inadequate, mortality from unsafe abortion most pronounced, giving birth most hazardous and childhood most difficult to survive.
These are based on national demographic surveys as well as on statistical models.
These are even more hazardous to interpret than those from surveys or partial death registration.
These are the countries that had the highest levels (207 on average) in 1990.
These countries started from a somewhat higher level than those that are on track: an average under-five mortality rate of 92 per 1000.
These deaths are most numerous in Africa and Asia.
This grouping of countries,1 categorized according to progress in under-five mortality during the 1990s, roughly corresponds to what happened in terms of neonatal.
This is not surprising, as only 14% of births in the world are registered.
This is partly because it takes longer to show results, partly because changes in maternal mortality are much more difficult to measure with the sources of information available at present.
Today, predictably, most maternal deaths occur in the poorest countries.
Trans-fatty acids (TFAs) are found in hydrogenated oils and fried foods i.e. breads, crackers, cookies, pastries, cereal, infant cereals and formula, potato chips, pudding, frozen foods, fast foods, etc.
Two thirds of newborn deaths occur in the WHO Regions of Africa (28%) and South-East Asia (36%).
Well-meaning friends and family sometimes have difficulty understanding your motives when you try to limit the non-nutritious or harmful foods your kids eat.
What you'll want to do is take an objective look at your final steps in putting your baby to sleep and make some changes if necessary.
Where the number of births will continue to grow well into the 2020s, even if fertility continues to drop.
Where the number of deaths continues to grow, because modest reductions of mortality rates are too small to keep up with the increasing numbers of births.
While the burden of neonatal deaths and stillbirths is very substantial, it is in many ways only part of the problem, as the same conditions that contribute to it also cause severe and often lifelong disability.
While they may feel you are depriving your children, rest assured you have science supporting you.
Why is it still necessary for this report to emphasize the importance of focusing on the health of mothers and children, after decades of priority status.
Worldwide, the number of live births will peak at 137 million per year towards 2015.
You may want to use massaging, cuddling, or sleepy-time music to help get your baby to fall asleep.
Your goals of helping him feel loved and secure while discovering ways to fall asleep without you — without your succumbing to the temptation of letting him cry it out — are admirable.
A good quality multi-vitamin/mineral supplement will fill in any gaps and help prevent some of the exhaustion many new moms experience.
AA and DHA are found in great concentrations in the human brain and nervous system.
After a few nights of sitting at the table by themselves until they finished their peas, they learned to eat them without protest.
All are soothing and healing and calendula has the added benefit of being anti-fungal.
All good foods can be treats, but we often think of only junk as such - so use the word judiciously.
Although many parents have found ways to temporarily suppress symptoms, many have now become determined to resolve their child’s skin condition altogether.
Although this is not actually the case, what we do know is that when water intake is low, a mother's body may not function optimally.
As a breastfeeding mother you should feel encouraged that you are doing what is best for your child.
Be sure that food is readily available to you in the weeks postpartum, as you will likely discover that you are ravenous.
Be sure that your diet contains optimal amounts of whole grains, and fresh, colourful fruits and vegetables.
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day for many, if not all, children.
Breakfast should contain some protein for lasting energy, helping to offset the midmorning meltdown.
Breastmilk is a good source of EFAs, and can be especially rich if you are sure to include EFA foods in your diet.
But even smokers should pursue breastfeeding, as their baby’s lungs actually stand a better chance at being healthy than if they were to be fed formula.
But some nutrients, such as B6, manganese, iodine, and selenium will continue to accumulate.
Caffeine and alcohol, both very common in the Western diet, are taken in by the infant through milk.
Chamomile, Plantain, and Calendula are herbs frequently used for skin conditions.
Children can be picky and inconsistent, so make sure that what they do eat is really good for them.
Children never fit into one mold, and another person’s rules usually need to be modified to fit your family.
Conditions such as eczema, diaper rash, and even the more benign cradle cap are on the rise.
Constant scratching will inevitably cause further irritation, and potentially a secondary problem such as a bacterial or fungal infection.
During the postpartum period, a diet low in protein may lead to an increase in recovery time.
During the prenatal and neonatal stages, the one substance that plays an important role in growth, neurologic development and function, and learning and behaviour is fat.
Eliminating a skin condition takes a great deal more effort than suppressing the symptoms, but the reward is once again seeing that perfect skin on your child.
Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs), (found in nuts, seeds, fish, and greens) are an important part of your diet during both pregnancy and lactation.
Even if your diet is rich in EFAs, the inclusion of TFAs will prohibit their metabolization and neither you nor the baby will receive all possible benefits.
Even with the additional intake of food, you will likely see a reduction in your weight without giving it much thought.
Everything your child eats should be nutritious and really good for his health.
Find these calories in nutrient-dense foods, not high sugar ones.
For obvious reasons smoking is best avoided, regardless of whether or not you are nursing.
If you begin a power struggle over meals, you risk it becoming long-term.
If your child is suffering from itching or pain, it is best to first try offering immediate relief.
If your diet is high in Trans-Fatty Acids (TFAs), these too will be passed on to the infant.
In addition to regular dietary sources, EFAs can be taken in supplement form.
In addition to TFAs, there are other substances in your diet that are passed on to your child.
Include at least 4 protein dense servings of food daily (i.e. tofu, nuts, beans, egg, fish, etc.).
It is often the parent/caregiver who is deriving pleasure from seeing children gleefully down a non-nutritious treat.
It is usually a caregiver that delights in serving a “dessert’ or “treat” more than the two-year-old who probably wouldn’t care otherwise if they’ve never had triple chocolate cake with whipped cream.
It was once thought that the more water you ingested, the more milk you would produce.
It will more likely foster a respect for healthy eating rather than an unhealthy association with mealtime.
Just introduce foods gently time and time again until they try it.
Knowledgeable doctors have begun to counsel patients to continue nursing through a course of pharmaceuticals because they know that the alternatives are worse than the baby receiving a dose of the drug themselves.
Learn to follow your child’s rules from time to time... they may surprise you.
Let children learn how to listen to their bodies - many adults have forgotten.
Let your child have a “creative” meal made up of healthy foods they like, while the rest of the family has their casserole, curry, or stir fry.
Make desserts healthy (not just fun) so that things like fruit, nuts, and yogurt become part of the meal, not the reward for finishing it.
Many adult eating disorders began in childhood, and many sufferers can remember these episodes at the dinner table as a child.
Many mothers worry about the research that has shown breastmilk to be a high source of environmental contaminants (PCBs, DDT, mercury, etc.), and some have doubted the safety of their milk.
Many of us can remember moms putting food on our plates and expecting us to eat it - or not.
Many products are suitable for nursing moms and have been used therapeutically when milk supply is deemed low, engorgement is common, or the infant is susceptible to numerous infections.
Many signs of the stereotypic “terrible-two” year-old is often hunger.
Many studies, and many caregivers, will attest to the fact that a good breakfast helps children function better mentally.
Many vitamins will pass through to your milk from your bloodstream and are therefore under your influence.
Missing breakfast can set the tone for their entire day and create a downward spiral of too tired to eat vs. too hungry to nap... and so on.
Most minerals will not. In some cases the breast has a ‘saturation-point’ by which you can be assured that nutrient levels will not surpass those needed by your child.
Never insist that they try something they don’t want to, and certainly never insist that they finish their plate.
Nevertheless, we do know that lactating requires extra protein in the mother’s diet.
Obviously the best place to get your nutrients is from the food you eat.
Our children know best more often than we give them credit for.
Prevention is the key because a miserable child often won’t eat, and you won’t obtain your objective of feeding them well.
Producing enough milk to feed a rapidly growing child can take a lot of energy - about 500 calories each day.
Rapid weight loss (more than 2-4 pounds per month after the first four weeks) may signal that you are not eating enough calories to both keep yourself healthy and produce milk for your baby.
Respecting that your child’s tastebuds and moods are as different from yours as is your spouse’s, or your neighbour’s means learning to break the rules of the “family meal” from time to time.
Scientists have discovered a source of liquid gold, for decades they have tried to dismantle, analyze, and recreate this amazing substance - to no avail.
Shortly after giving birth, chemical messages are sent throughout a woman’s body, instructing it to produce breastmilk.
Small amounts in your diet, timed around nursing sessions (if predictable) are usually not a problem.
So long as it is healthy, and doesn’t happen every night of the week, letting a child choose their own meals usually won’t create the problems our parents thought it would.
Some mothers will experience an intense thirst as their baby latches on.
Some studies had determined that the protein content of breastmilk could be enhanced with an increase in dietary protein, while other more complete studies make no such correlation.
Some tummies are really good at letting their owners know when to eat, and how much to eat.
Taking good care of yourself and eating a healthy diet will help you meet the demands of your nursing relationship.
TFAs, which are found in hydrogenated oils and processed foods, have been linked to cardiovascular risk, neurological underdevelopment, and other life-long risks in children.
That way if they end up having two bites of potato for dinner, you can be confident that they at least had a great dinner, snack, etc.
The composition of fat found in your milk is highly variable and very much under the influence of your diet.
The extra fluid you are creating must be supported with additional fluids in your diet.
The growing reality for many parents, however, is learning to help their children cope with irritating and sometimes disfiguring skin disorders.
The influx of fortified foods on the market, however, will likely decrease the need for any additional supplementation if they are included in your diet regularly.
The mechanisms involved in its production are mind-boggling, as are the various benefits it provides to the infant.
The only known source of this magical fluid is a mother’s breast, and it’s not giving up its secrets easily.
The parent EFAs (linoleic acid and linolenic acid) are converted into arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
The point is to get them to eat healthfully, not develop an association between food and control.
The protein found in your breastmilk is easily and quickly digested.
The protein has the perfect amino acid profile for growth, one which is unique to human milk.
There is not much room in that little tummy, think carefully before filling it with junk.
There were few struggles back then because children quickly learned that if they didn’t eat what was served to them, they would go hungry.
Therefore drinking approximately 8-10 glasses, but no more, of water each day is very important.
They are thought to be part of the reason why the human brain has developed advanced cognitive abilities beyond that of most other mammals.
Thiamin, B12, folic acid, and Vitamin D are crucial to infant development and have been observed to be dangerously low in some women.
Thiamin, B12, folic acid, and Vitamin D may be important supplements to consider if you are at all concerned that your diet does not include enough.
This is one reason why developing healthy eating habits early is so important.
Through diet we can increase its potential and help ensure that it is of the highest possible quality.
Unfortunately the baby’s immature liver will have difficulty processing these chemicals, even if no outward signs of ingestion are visible (irritability, sleeplessness, etc.).
Vegan mothers should definitely watch their intake of vitamins B12 and D as these are typically found in animal foods.
Water is a sharp realization to a new mother that all of the liquid coming out of her infant (which can sometimes seem copious!) had to enter via her breast milk.
We may never know how to replicate breastmilk, and we are only just beginning to understand its value.
What is important to recognize is that what is found (or not found) in the alternatives to breastmilk is far more dangerous than these chemicals.
When a parent visualizes their unborn child, they usually picture soft, perfect skin - smooth and unblemished.
While most studies lean toward school age children, this fact should be applied to babies and toddlers as well.
Within hours of a meal, the type of fat you consumed will become the predominant fat in your milk.
Your child can derive smiles and joy from many other places - it doesn’t have to be junk food.
A combination of the above herbs has proven an effective substitute for children.
A proper diagnosis will give you more confidence in the remedies you choose.
A vaporizer used in the room where your child sleeps, or some time spent in a steamy bathroom before bed can help too.
Adjust the upper portion of the bed so that it slopes down toward their feet by placing something under the mattress or the legs of the bed.
All will moisturize the skin from the inside out and aid the body in eliminating toxins and waste material.
Alternately you could use a heat pack filled with flax seeds, buckwheat, or rice.
An elimination diet is usually necessary to detect which foods, if any, are causing problems for your child.
Avoiding potentially allergenic soaps, shampoos, perfumes, and laundry detergents is especially important.
Bach Flower Remedies will address the emotional component of a child’s skin condition.
Be wary of practitioners who put nursing moms or small children on very restrictive elimination diets.
Because the body is so busy trying to ward off the ‘invader’, it is incapable of appropriately dealing with a bacterial overgrowth that may occur in the warm moist environment of the middle ear.
Both bottle-fed and breast-fed babies can absorb evening primrose or borage oil directly though their skin.
Both will help the skin heal itself and stimulate the body’s healing capabilities.
Breastfed babies obtain their EFAs through breastmilk, so nursing mothers would do best taking additional supplements such as evening primrose, borage, or flax seed oil.
Breastfeeding mothers should consider altering their own diets as well.
But a subsequent side effect can be the proliferation of yeast (Candida) in the body.
Children may have difficulty sleeping when their skin is itchy and sore, but sleep is vital in helping the body heal itself.
Choose clothing for your child that is ‘breathable’ and non-irritating.
Colourful fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and vegetable proteins will provide the nutrients needed for cell growth and immune functioning.
Dairy seems to be the most common culprit and therefore is often the first to be tested.
Dairy, wheat, corn, egg, soy, citrus fruits, and chocolate are the most common triggers.
Dip a soft cloth in very warm water or tea and wring it out.
Discontinue if massage causes your child too much discomfort.
Don’t be surprised to see other changes in your child once the offending food or foods have been eliminated.
Ear infections are one of the most common reasons antibiotics are prescribed to children.
Easily converted into simple sugars, refined grain products such as white rice, bread, and pasta may contribute to an overgrowth of yeast.
Environmental sensitivities and allergies are harder to avoid, but important to identify.
Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs) are critical to the health of our skin.
Evening Primrose Oil and Borage Oil are both useful for reducing inflammation and relieving discomfort.
Food allergies will need to be identified and avoided until the body is reasonably strong enough to resist an inappropriate immune response.
Food sensitivities and allergies are common amongst sufferers of skin disorders.
Foods rich in zinc include soy beans, wheat germ, and pumpkin seeds.
For many young children, ear infections become recurrent and difficult to avoid.
Garlic is effective in combating infections including those that are fungal. Include plenty in your child’s diet.
Hats, in particular, can aggravate scalp conditions if they restrict air-flow for too long or trap moisture.
Herbal nervines such as catnip, passionflower, skullcap, chamomile, and valerian will better help your child relax and lessen the pain and itching.
Hummous, garlic bread, sauces and dips are great vehicles for fresh garlic.
If the lymph nodes (glands) are swollen, lightly massage them using the same essential oil blend to help them drain and to relieve discomfort.
If the pain is caused by congestion, particularly that associated with a cold, keep the mucous thinned by having your child drink very warm herbal teas such as lemon balm, catnip, spearmint, ginger, and/or licorice root.
If your child complains of ear pain, hearing loss, is unable to lie flat, wakes frequently at night, is extremely fussy, has a fever, or has fluid draining from his/her ear, you should see a physician.
If your child has ever been treated with antibiotics, you will likely witness a greater susceptibility to fungal infections until the probiotics are re-established in the gut.
In infants and young children the eustachian tube is shorter and lays in a more horizontal position (over time it will develop a more downward angle).
It can become extremely difficult to feed a child a restricted diet if they are already a picky eater.
It is best to work with a practitioner who can help you identify problematic foods while still ensuring that a healthy diet is maintained.
It is known that many cases would have otherwise resolved themselves without treatment, and many practitioners recognize that repeat prescriptions are more common once antibiotics have been administered.
Keep your child’s environment reasonably free of environmental allergens by cleaning often, using hypoallergenic materials in the bedroom, and installing an air filter.
Keep your child’s skin exposed to fresh air and moderate amounts of sunshine whenever possible.
Life changes such as starting daycare or school, moving to a new house, or the arrival of a new sibling often correspond with flare-ups.
Many children will get pain relief from a warm compress placed over the affected ear.
Many parents are directed to apply strong anti-fungal creams to their child’s skin.
Massage from along the back of the ear down toward the jaw line in repeated strokes.
Massaging around the ear can help the fluid drain into the Eustachian tube and provide some pain relief.
Mothers should also consider breastfeeding for as long as possible - especially if their child is susceptible to skin problems.
Occasionally a child may be sensitive to more than one thing in their diet and detective work becomes more crucial.
Occasionally the problem can be simpler resolved with the addition of something that may have been otherwise lacking.
Older children can get their EFAs from foods such as fish, nuts, seeds, flax seed oil, and leafy greens.
Once a food has been completely eliminated, observe any changes in your child’s skin.
Other concerns such as mold and dust are harder to avoid.
Other remedies may be useful, depending on the needs of the child.
Others may provide more immediate relief, but it will be short-lived unless the ‘big picture’ is addressed.
Parents will often use over-the-counter pharmaceuticals such as Benedryl for relief and to induce sleep.
Probiotics, commonly referred to as acidophilus, will help support the child’s immune system and is effective in combating a fungal (yeast) infection.
Prop your child’s head up at a 30 degree angle while lying down.
Refined Foods and Sugar are nutritionally unnecessary and detrimental to your child.
Rescue Remedy Cream can bring quick relief to raw and irritated skin.
Seasonal allergies (hay fever) and sensitivities to household allergens such as dust, mold, pet dander, etc. may do two things first, reduce your child’s immune capabilities and second, illicit an allergic response that results in the swelling and blocking of the Eustachian tubes.
Secondhand smoke has been proven by research to increase a child’s risk of ear infections.
Sensitivities to pollen, mold, pet dander, dust, and food proteins may trigger reoccurring ear infections.
Should this tube become blocked, infection can readily develop in the middle ear and the subsequent fluids are trapped.
Some solutions, such as becoming more aware of food allergens, take time and persistence.
Some such as second-hand-smoke, animal dander, and household cleaners are easy to eliminate and control for most households.
Soups, teas, and water will keep your child hydrated.
Stress and anxiety are common triggers, and until addressed will continue to aggravate the skin.
Symptoms such as respiratory problems and digestive upsets may also disappear.
The ear is divided into three parts The outer ear is the area most visible.
The effectiveness of antibiotics in the treatment of ear infections is still being debated in the literature.
The essential oils lavender, roman chamomile and/or tea tree can be added to the water or dropped onto the heat pack.
The eustachian tube is found in the middle ear of a baby.
The immune system’s response to foreign invaders usually results in inflammatory congestion which can block the Eustachian tubes.
The inner ear is rich with nerve endings that receive the sound.
The remedy Walnut helps a child cope with change, and Holly can address jealousy.
The sound travels through the ear canal, past the ear drum, down to the middle ear.
These all tend to maintain their heat longer and are less messy than a wet cloth.
These foods also offer negligible amounts of nutrients and therefore do not support the body’s healing processes.
This can be done with or without oil but if massage oil is used you might consider adding essential oils.
This encourages drainage and discourages the feeling of pressure often felt when lying flat.
This is where the bones that transmit the sound to the inner ear are found.
This makes it more difficult for excess fluid to drain properly.
This passage way connects to the nose and the throat, and allows drainage of any fluid collected in the middle ear.
Topical applications are also ideal for infants who would otherwise have difficulty taking these supplements internally.
Tubes can become blocked by congestion caused by a cold or other upper respiratory infection, or by a reaction to a food or environmental allergen.
Vitamin A and beta carotene can be found in egg yolks, sweet potatoes, cantaloupe, and apricots.
Vitamin C should be taken in conjunction with bioflavonoids for optimal utilization.
Vitamin C, taken regularly, will promote healing and support the immune system.
When it is cool enough to touch, place it over the child’s ear.
When working with children and their parents, I often hesitate to ask them to start eliminating many things from their diet and environment.
Yeast infections may make a child more susceptible to ear infections as they can leave their body’s immune system weakened and vulnerable.
You might consider adding lavender essential oil to the vaporizer, or eucalyptus oil if your child is over the age of two.
Your little one is miserable and you are fraught with the knowledge that it is yet again another ear infection.
Zinc, Vitamin A, and Beta Carotene will all help protect against infection and aid in healing.
A lack of probiotics sets the stage for fungal growth that has been linked to triggering ear infections.
Add 3 drops of lavender, 3 drops of roman chamomile, and 3 drops of tea tree essential oils to 30 ml of grapeseed oil.
Add 3-4 drops of GSE (found in health food stores) to 30 ml of vegetable glycerin.
Additional substances support the growth of intestinal flora which enhances the immune system.
Although prevention is the best medicine for ear infections, there are many natural solutions to the pain and discomfort your child experiences.
As you listen attentively to her noises, and watch her, you will learn the difference between sleeping snorts and “I'm waking up and I need you now” noises.
Babies moan, grunt, snuffle, whimper, and even cry in their sleep.
Be sure that the child's diet is free of refined and/or concentrated sugars (table sugar, corn syrup, honey) and low in naturally occurring sugars, such as those found in fruit juices.
Be sure to brush their teeth afterward as this acidic vitamin can erode tooth enamel.
Breastfed babies can taste garlic in Mom's breastmilk after she eats some of this potent anti-microbial herb.
Breastfeeding also supplies the child with important immune enhancing substances, further reduces the risk of developing allergies by protecting the intestines ("leaky" intestines allow more foreign material in to the blood stream) and contributes to appropriate physical development of the Eustachian tubes.
Breastfeeding has been clinically proven to reduce the risk of ear infections.
Breastmilk is also a convenient carrier for many of the following suggested remedies.
By the time I looked up, he was 12 months old, firmly and totally entrenched in a breastfeeding-to-sleep association.
Chewable and liquid vitamin C supplements are available for children.
Children who are prone to chronic ear infections have benefited from continual use of Echinacea throughout the cold and flu season with a one week break out of every four.
Cover and let sit for 10 minutes. Infants take 1 tsp tea 3-4 times a day.
Cover with just enough olive oil and heat gently for 20-30 minutes.
Cut a thick slab of a yellow onion and warm it using a warm oven, microwave, or boiling water.
Don't be surprised if your child has "garlic breath" shortly after a treatment, as garlic travels quickly to the lungs.
Ear infections are notorious for repeating themselves.
Echinacea stimulates the white blood cells that are necessary for eliminating pathogens.
Especially useful if the ear drum has ruptured and internal drops are not appropriate.
Every baby is different, but about ten to sixty seconds between removals usually works.
Fermented foods such as kefir and yogurt are good sources, as is a probiotic supplement (commonly referred to as acidophilus).
For a child under 8 months, breastmilk should still be the primary source of calories.
For children that are old enough to chew, zinc lozenges are very convenient.
For smaller children, and older ones who might refuse to eat it, infused garlic oil can be rubbed onto the soles of the feet.
For some unknown and many known reasons, some children have less intestinal flora than is necessary to properly digest food and protect the body from the growth of pathogens.
From the very moment he was born, he slept beside me, nursing to sleep for every nap and every bedtime.
Garlic is surprisingly well tolerated by little taste buds - if they are introduced to it early in life.
However, in our world, few parents have the luxury of putting everything else on hold until their baby gets older.
I am a follower of the “never let your babies cry” rule, and I took it very seriously.
I certainly disagree, and so would my baby! It is probably the most positive, natural, pleasant sleep association a baby can have.
I have heard a number of sleep experts refer to this as a “negative sleep association.”
I suspect that this because of the sleep-association affect that I explained earlier.
If a baby is sucking strongly or swallowing regularly when feeding, wait a few minutes until he slows his pace.
If baby struggles against this and fusses or roots for you or his bottle or pacifier, go ahead and replace the nipple, but repeat the removal process as often as necessary until he falls asleep.
If you had nothing whatsoever to do besides take care of your baby, this would be a very pleasant way to pass your days and nights until he naturally outgrew the need.
If your baby doesn't nap well, don't trouble yourself with trying to use the removal technique during the day for naps.
If your baby is waking up every hour or two to breastfeed, bottle-feed, or locate his pacifier, you may be wondering just what it is that causes him to wake up so often.
If your child is dealing with a severe yeast infection as determined by a qualified health practitioner, it is important to work closely with your caregiver in making the necessary dietary changes.
In other words, be prepared to disrupt your own nights for a while to make some important, worthwhile long-term changes.
instead of leaving him there and going back to bed, or letting him fall asleep at the breast, let him suck for a few minutes until his sucking slows and he is relaxed and sleepy.
It is best to continue nursing until your child weans themselves, which could be 2 years or more.
It is very difficult for the body to replace the missing flora without close attention paid to dietary sources.
It may take two to five (or even more) attempts, but eventually your baby will fall asleep without the pacifier or nipple in her mouth.
It's all a matter of your perception and your personal needs.
Last night he was nursing and I pulled him off and put my finger under his chin.
Make a blend of the following: lemon balm, catnip, ginger, licorice, spearmint, and chamomile and pour 4 cups of boiling water over 3 tsp of the blend.
Many infections are precipitated by a viral infection attacking the respiratory system; this approach will cover all bases.
Mix well and massage a few drops at a time around the outside of the ear.
Most, if not all, children would benefit from daily supplementation if they are prone to infections.
My baby, Coleton, spent much time in his early months in my arms, his little head bobbing to the tune of my computer keyboard.
Natural remedies can be very effective at curbing an ear infection, but a strong healthy immune system is even better.
Often the way your baby falls asleep will affect the rest of his awakenings for the night.
Often, especially at first, your baby then will startle and root for the nipple.
Older children approximately 1/2 cup 3-4 times a day but tea should be warm but not hot.
Once you get your baby sleeping better at night, you can then work on the naptime sleep.
Otherwise a dose at the first sign of symptoms, and every 3-4 hours thereafter may prevent the problem from progressing.
Patience and diligence are key, but breaking the cycle is possible.
Place the buds of the unopened flowers into just enough olive oil to cover.
Places 2-3 cloves of chopped garlic into a double boiler or small sauce pan.
Raw garlic is better than most supplements and creative ways exist for getting children to eat it.
Recipes such as garlic bread, hummus, and guacamole are popular.
Reduce the dosage until stools normalize and watch for signs of dehydration should it last for more than one day.
Remember that good naps mean better nighttime sleep — and better nighttime sleep means better naps.
Research has shown that maternal supplementation during pregnancy and breastfeeding lowers the risk of childhood allergies by increasing protective factors in the breastmilk.
Seal the jar tightly and place in sunny window for at least 2 weeks.
Some are easier to chew than others, and some varieties contain Echinacea or other immune boosting remedies.
Some babies can continue this pattern and still sleep through the night.
Sometimes a child barely seems to recover from one before another one occurs.
Sugar is known to lower the body's resistance to infection, and furthermore it feeds the yeast that may be triggering the infections in the first place.
The difference with your baby, who requires nighttime care every hour or two, is that he is involving you in all his brief awakening periods.
The most important time to use Pantley's gentle removal plan is the first falling asleep of the night.
The next step to helping your baby sleep longer is to determine the difference between sleeping noises and awake noises.
The nursing mother can take an adult dose and pass on the benefits via her breastmilk.
The problem with this association is not the association itself, but our busy lives.
The reality is that brief nighttime awakenings are a normal part of human sleep, regardless of age.
Then break the seal with your finger and gently remove the pacifier or nipple.
Therefore the best ways to eliminate the bacteria causing the infection is to stimulate the child's own immune defenses and utilize nature
To take the steps to change your baby's sleep association, you must complicate night waking for a while, but in the long run you can wean your baby from using his pacifier, bottle, or your breast as his only nighttime association.
Try to very gently hold his mouth closed with your finger under his chin, or apply pressure to his chin, just under his lip, at the same time rocking or swaying with him.
Usually, after the initial burst of activity, your baby will slow to a more relaxed, “fluttery” pace; this is a good time to begin your removal attempts.
Very often we have a routine we have followed with our babies since birth. The final step before sleep is always nursing or having a bottle.
Vitamin C not only increases the immune response, but is also anti-inflammatory.
What I didn't understand, though, is that babies make sounds in their sleep.
When it has cooled, remove it and reheat it for another application.
When it is cool enough to handle, wrap it in cheesecloth and hold it on the affected ear.
When she has done this a number of times over a period of days, you will notice the removals are much easier, and her awakenings are less frequent.
When your baby wakes, go ahead and pop his pacifier or his bottle in his mouth, or nurse him.
Whether the mother used them during pregnancy, or they are used at any point in a child's life, antibiotics create an imbalance between the protective flora we need a lot of and the negative flora we do not.
Whole grains; vegetable proteins such as beans, peas, and nuts; colourful fruits and vegetables; and adequate water/fluids should make up the bulk of your child's diet.
With this in mind, I will give you a number of ideas so that you can gradually, and lovingly, help your baby learn to fall asleep without this very powerful sleep aid.
You child may also experience loose stools while taking therapeutic dosages of vitamin C.
You may not even see this as a problem, in which case it is not.
Your baby makes a “sleep association,” wherein he associates certain things with falling asleep and believes he needs these things to fall asleep.
Your baby, like my Coleton, has learned to associate sucking (having your nipple or his bottle or pacifier in his mouth) with sleeping.
Zinc supplements also boost the immune response to infection.
A group of parents and their babies and young children gathered in a church basement in a low income neighbourhood to meet with two teachers who taught them rhymes and songs to use with their children, and also told them stories for their own delight.
A variety of resources are available for purchase, including rhyme books and CDs in English and French, storybooks, training manuals, and videos.
Activity focuses on interactive rhymes, stories, and songs, all presented orally and through the air.
Apprenticeship Training is hands-on training with an experienced, accredited P-CMGP teacher.
As a result such children do not perform well in elementary schools and many drop out of school and some end up in the streets.
As a result, the P-CMGP has spread across Canada and beyond, and many different kinds of organisations and agencies now offer the program to the families they serve.
As the children grew, the need for a program for two-to-four-year-olds became clear, and a second level of the P-CMGP, in which parents learned stories to tell to their children, was developed and added to the program.
Celia agreed, and together, Katherine and Celia sought funding to bring the program to families in the general community.
Celia Lottridge and Katherine Grier, both storytellers and educators, taught in the program with Joan.
Children simply stay at home till they are of school age, as no child will be admitted to school under the age of seven.
Community-based programs give parents the opportunity to build on their strengths and learn new skills.
Drop out was one of the problems observed during the first survey of 1994.
Each program has at least two teachers who share all teaching duties and take time together after each session to discuss their observations of the interactions within the group.
For over 20 years, the Parent-Child Mother Goose Program has been helping parents and caregivers nurture their relationships with babies and young children.
For the new academic year, which started in Sept 1999, 75 children were enrolled.
Groups are small enough to ensure that the needs of individuals as well as of the group as a whole can be met.
In 1984, Barry Dickson, a social worker and storyteller who worked with a large caseload of families who had barriers to bonding, and Joan Bodger, a therapist and storyteller, planned a pilot project that would serve families identified as “at risk” by the Toronto Children’s Aid Society, a child protection agency.
In 1986, the Parent-Child Mother Goose Program (P-CMGP) offered one group for parents and infants in the Lakeshore area of Etobicoke, Ontario.
In order for adults to relax and participate fully in the group, an assistant may be available to supervise walking children in the Infant program, and for childcare in a playroom during storytelling in the Two-to-Four Program.
In Sept. 1999, a follow-up survey was conducted in the same neighborhood where LMCC has been operating since 1994.
In September 1999 the intake was limited to 75 children.
In the mid-nineties, Celia developed P-CMGP teacher training workshops to train individuals and organisations in the philosophy and methods of the program.
In the selected community priority was given to children who waste their precious time on the street instead of attending pre-schools or kindergartens.
It has a national structure, with regional offices and local programs, and is governed by a Board of Directors from across Canada.
It is also pleasing to note that all children were vaccinated against polio by a visiting medical team from the Ministry of Health.
It was observed that this community is situated in a very disadvantaged area, which is also highly polluted and many children are seen on the streets playing in very unhygienic conditions.
It was obvious from the survey that the drop out rate has substantially been reduced.
Level Two workshops deepen teachers' understanding and abilities.
Local Programs provide direct service for families in communities, encourage participants to grow in leadership skills, network with other community organisations, create opportunities for local rhyme and storytelling groups, fundraise locally.
Lucy Mother and Child Care (LMCC) is an indigenous organization founded in September 1993.
MD is responsible for: training, the network of programs, resource development, including the website and professional support for our workshop facilitators and members, setting and maintaining standards, advocacy, national fundraising and research.
Now the children could stay the whole day having enough time for playing and learning.
One 7 year old female child was found to have seizure disorder and was referred to the Ethio-Swedish Hospital for further evaluation and management.
Our programs are delivered through local community centres and agencies, and can offer a safe entry point for parents living in situations of risk.
Our programs have been particularly effective for parents living in situations of risk.
Our workshops and programs have assisted many organisations in fulfilling their mandate for serving families with young children.
Our workshops have been purchased by agencies and organisations across Canada and internationally.
Out of the 122 children examined, 29% (36) were found to be healthy with no clinically identified problems.
P-CMG Programs are run by accredited teachers, report regularly to the office and pay an annual fee.
Parents gain skills and confidence which can enable them to create positive family patterns during their children's crucial early years, and give their children healthy early experiences with language and communication.
Practicum Experience is experience teaching the P-CMGP.
Printed versions of the rhymes and songs are supplied at the end of a series of meetings when the participants have had time to internalise some of the material and use it in their everyday lives.
Program teachers are trained in the principles, materials and methods needed to run the Program effectively.
Programs are based on the training and resources of the Parent-Child Mother Goose Program.
Programs are enjoyable for both teacher and participant, and offer transferable skills for staff to apply to other areas of community service.
Regional offices are currently in place in Toronto and British Columbia, and are coordinated by experienced P-CMGP teachers and workshop facilitators who provide local information and support.
Rhymes and Songs and Storytelling in the Parent-Child Mother Goose Program provide opportunities to receive in-depth training in the materials and methods of the Program and to meet and share with other P-CMGP teachers.
Stories which the parents can learn and tell to their children may also be included.
Storytelling is an integral part of the Program with the stories being chosen and told for the enjoyment of the adults.
Teacher training combines workshop training with apprenticeship training or practicum experience.
Teacher Training Workshops are taught by accredited facilitators who teach participants the principles and methods of the Parent-Child Mother Goose Program.
That first program was followed by others in different neighbourhoods, and before long, parents with an aptitude for the program were being trained as program teachers through apprenticeship training.
The annual general health checkup was conducted in March 1999 for the pre-school children with the help of three volunteer physicians from the TikurAnbessa Hospital namely: DrsKaleabTesfaye, HabtamuFekadu and TsinuelGirma.
The atmosphere is accepting and supportive, with the intention of building the confidence of all participants, and creating a feeling of community and mutual support within the group.
The children participate as is appropriate to their stage of development and inclination.
The commonest health problem identified was intestinal parasitism, which accounts for 36%, followed by skin infections, 15%, eye infections, 11% ear infections, upper respiratory tract infections, dental cavities and xerophthalmia account for the remaining 12% of the total.
The concept of pre-schools or kindergarten is not popular in particular in poor communities in Ethiopia, be it in urban or rural areas.
The first LMCC pre-school was established in September 1994, with an intake of 25 children, this number rose in subsequent years to 150, which was above the physical capacity of the center.
The first project area selected by LMCC is a community living in the industrial zone of Addis Ababa, behind the Addis lyre Factory.
The founders of the program, Celia Lottridge and Katherine Grier, were inspired by a pilot project created by Barry Dickson and Joan Bodger.
The idea was to begin at the beginning with the relationship between parent and baby or young child, and to use the pleasure and power of rhymes, songs and stories taught and experienced orally in a group setting to nurture the parent-child relationship and to foster family wellness.
The information you provide may be used to deliver services, and to keep you informed and up to date on the activities of PCMG, including programs, services, special events, funding needs, opportunities to volunteer or to make a donation, and related information.
The main aim of LMCC is to provide pro-school education for children from low income families.
The Mother Goose Enrichment Program was based on Barry’s experiments using rhymes and stories with the children in his care.
The P-CMGP is a group program in which parents/caregivers take part together with their infants or young children.
The pace is slow and relaxed with plenty of time for repetition of material and casual discussion of issues and questions that arise.
The Parent Child Mother Goose Program respects your privacy.
The Parent-Child Mother Goose Program has grown and become a multifaceted organisation.
The Parent-Child Mother Goose Program is a group experience for parents and their babies and young children which focuses on the pleasure and power of using rhymes, songs, and stories together.
The Parent-Child Mother Goose Program started in 1986 in Toronto, Ontario.
The Parent-Child Mother Goose Program Teacher Training Workshop covers the materials, methods and underlying ideas of the program.
The prescribed medicines were purchased partly by parents and partly by LMCC.
The Program can be run in a variety of settings and can be offered either to a particular client group or to the public at large.
The Program is aimed at families in need of support for any of a variety of reasons.
The result of the survey showed that most of the children who benefited from the LMCC Pre-school are now enrolled in primary schools.
The Teacher Training Workshops have led to hundreds of Parent-Child Mother Goose Programs® being offered in communities across Canada.
The three teachers all recruited from the community have now more time to give due attention to the children.
These children come from the surveyed neighborhood.
They found that the shared words, actions, images and feelings of rhymes and stories enhanced the relationship between parents and their children and gave them long-lasting resources.
They help to build and strengthen communities, and provide a safe entry point into services.
This network of Programs is growing and is strengthened by sharing experiences through newsletters, the Internet and conferences.
This shift towards families with differing degrees and kinds of needs proved beneficial, as parents became resources and models for one another.
Those establishing a Program use the trademarked name and enter into an annual Agreement with the Parent-Child Mother Goose Program.
We do not rent, sell or trade any personal any personal information including mailing lists.
We offer ongoing support to Programs through e-mail and telephone consultation, our website, program visits and conferences.
We protect the personal information we collect and adhere to all legislative requirements with respect to protecting your privacy.
When the pilot project was over, Katherine Grier approached Celia Lottridge and said that the program needed to be continued.
While outreach remained concentrated on families most in need, the program was open to all.
A 2003 study on trafficking in the region by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) estimated that 1,000 Mozambican woman and children were being trafficked to South Africa every year, mainly for sexual exploitation.
A collaboration among individuals and institutions established in 2005.
A SC statement called for the passage of the proposed legislation, more cooperation between countries in Southern Africa, increased awareness on the dangers of trafficking and to ensure that survivors had access to proper care.
A UN report also says the countries were not making adequate progress in providing health care.
According to Chris McIvor, country director for SC-UK in Mozambique, the increased number of cases reported points to a deeper and more pervasive problem throughout Southern Africa.
According to McIvor the economic and social factors that create the vulnerability continues to worsen in many countries in the region.
All in all the team was highly appreciative of what LMCC has done for the welfare of the children of the community and that it should intensify efforts also in the future.
All this is closely related to diet, the most serious aspect being the speeding up of growth, as a result of hormonal stimulation.
Although the practice is believed to be growing, accurate statistics on the magnitude of the problem remain elusiver.
An authorized accountant audited LMCC account of the years 1996-99.
As a result such children do not perform well in elementary schools and many drop out of school and some end up in the streets.
As a start, collecting, exchanging and analysing information on organized criminal networks is a fruitful approach to addressing trafficking in persons, especially with information on routes used by traffickers.
As soon as weaning is over, the main emphasis should be on fruit and vegetables, with the addition of cereals and natural seeds.
As you can see, animal foods are unnecessary; to raise a child you need two arms and two breasts.
At AVI we have always sought to combat false information.
At that time women started working in factories, which had an unnatural effect on childcare.
Besides, it is the underlying cause of a fifth of maternal deaths at childbirth.
Characteristics of mammals include their love for their young, which is determined by brain development, and suckling of them.
Child will be admitted to school under the age of seven.
Children eat the wrong food, overhigh in calories, and fall ill more and more often.
Consequently, no suspected trafficker has ever been tried for the crime, even though the practice is illegal under international law.
Cow's milk combined with meat, fish and cheese and other many things.
Cow's milk contains 4 times as much protein; rabbit's milk, 10 times as much.
Cow's milk was chosen because it was so easily available worldwide.
Currently, even where trafficking is criminalised, cases are not investigated or investigations do not result in convictions.
Drop out was one of the problems observed during the first survey of 1994.
Exploitation and abuse of human trafficking victims, mainly taken from Mozambique to South Africa, has seen a surge in media headlines but experts warn this is just "the tip of the iceberg."
Feeding with milk from another species, treated to make it closer to that of the correct species, leads to dangerous counter indications.
For the new academic year, which started in Sept 1999, 75 children were enrolled.
Higher levels of unemployment, young people looking for better lives, demands in some countries for illegal, cheap labour create the conditions that are ripe for trafficking.
However, the report indicates that up to 3.2 million babies die each year in the first 12 weeks after birth.
Human milk contains 1.2% protein, minus 0.3% non-proteic nitrogen, which leaves 0.9%.
Human milk is high in glucose, which feeds the brain, but low in mineral salts.
Human trafficking is a problem in the whole Southern Africa region though South Africa is the regional magnet for most countries.
Humans are mammals needing less protein, since we grow more slowly, over a period of 25 years, and sexual maturity is reached later.
If legislation is not yet in place other existing legislation to prosecute the traffickers should be considered.
In 12 countries, the average annual rate of reduction in under-five mortality since 1990 has not changed, the report says.
In 1999 some efforts were made to improve facilities for the reading room, which caters for older children.
In Africa, close to a million children below the age of five die from malaria annually.
In Sept. 1999, a follow-up survey was conducted in the same neighborhood where LMCC has been operating since 1994.
In the 68 countries, coverage rates for pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria treatment are poor and are not improving, the document adds.
In the nineteenth century menstruation started around 18-20 years of age, whereas in the 1960s it had dropped to around age 14, and now first takes place at age 8-10.
Kenya is among countries that account for 97 per cent of maternal and child deaths globally.
Lack of awareness and "the clandestine nature makes it difficult to investigate trafficking cases and identify all role-players".
Like any illegal practice which brings financial profits to people who carry out such activities, it is highly likely that there are many more cases that remain unreported.
Many come on Saturdays to read and study at the center.
Meat is not necessary, is not a source of selenium, is not a food to be taken daily, as this runs counter to guidelines for healthy eating and the recommendations of the European Code for Cancer Prevention; and meat is not essential for children to grow properly.
Most penal codes include crimes such as rape, abduction and fraud, and these crimes are often committed in trafficking cases.
Mozambican law makes no provision for prosecuting alleged human traffickers.
Now the children could stay the whole day having enough time for playing and learning.
Of course the amount absorbed by the body is lower than this.
Other event of the year for the Pre-school was the evaluation of the program by a team of experts sent by the Addis Ababa City Administration.
People are tempted to find what they need and become susceptible to the promises that people make.
People were not however aware of its different composition, and its use led to disasters: children died.
Pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, together with under-nutrition, caused 54 per cent of the 10.6 million annual deaths in the first five years, the report states.
Shongwe has helped hundreds of children who passed through his home on their way back to Mozambique.
The auditors report and recommendations were approved by the Board.
The clandestine nature makes it difficult to investigate trafficking cases and identify all role-players.
The consumption of non-natural food causes the human body to be prone to more frequent illness, starting in the first months of life.
The emotional "food" is the most important: touching, the proximity of the parents.
The fight against trafficking calls for broad, multi-agency and cooperative criminal justice responses, nationally, regionally and internationally.
The first batch of children has reached the 5th grade.
The first LMCC pre-school was established in September 1994, with an intake of 25 children, this number rose in subsequent years to 150.
The history of mother and child care begins halfway through the nineteenth century with the industrial revolution.
The issue is broader than the orthodox image of trafficking, where individuals are transported across a border against their will.
The latest involved the sexual enslavement of three Mozambican children, aged between 14 and 16, at a brothel in South Africa's capital, Pretoria.
The main reason behind what is going on is there is more poverty in Mozambique so people are attracted to South Africa to find a better life.
The media however tell us the opposite, but often they have been forced to change their stance because of pressure from us.
The Mozambican Council of Ministers approved a specific law against human trafficking and a proposed Children's Act in 2007, but both are still pending parliament's approval.
The Mozambican girls found in Pretoria, now reunited with their families in the Mozambican capital, Maputo, had been lured across the border by the promise of work and an education.
The obese child now symbolises a worsening pathology.
The purpose of the evaluation was to determine if the program has met its objectives.
The report shows that poor nutrition was the key cause of more than a third of deaths among children under the age of five.
The report was launched at the second Countdown to 2015 Conference held in Cape Town, South Africa, from April 17 to 19, with the 118th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly.
The result of the survey showed that most of the children who benefited from the LMCC Pre-school are now enrolled in primary schools.
The situation has gradually changed down the years, and this continues to this day, with baby food and baby care very much the province of specialists such as the pediatrician, pharmacist and so on.
The team encouraged LMCC to forward its future plans and programs to the appropriate body.
The team raised several questions for which it sought answers from the LMCC Coordinator of the Project.
The traffickers we have spoken to say they are taking advantage of the lack of legislation, a hole in the legal system; they know they will be charged with only part of what they are doing if they get caught, like sexual harassment or kidnapping.
The voluntary nature of the movement of children across borders should not dilute the concern we must feel about what happens to them in other countries.
The World Health Organisation cites a number of areas that have not been addressed in relation to the health of pregnant mothers and children below five years.
There have been 52 suspected cases of trafficking involving young women and children since the beginning of the year, according to Save the Children-United Kingdom (SC-UK) Mozambique.
There is enormous confusion, since methods have ceased to be passed on from generation to generation, and are communicated by the media instead.
They may not be trafficked in the classical sense of the term, but they have numerous rights infringed and merit our protection.
This information though is not disinterested, and even apparently scientific and unbiased advice is manipulated - it is false advice, advertising.
Thousands of children leave Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Swaziland and Lesotho every year to cross the border to South Africa without documentation.
Through the unified effort, national and international policy makers, programme implementers, development and media partners and researchers are working together to summarise, synthesise and disseminate the best and most recent information on country-level progress.
Trafficking in persons is dynamic, adaptable, opportunistic and - takes advantage of conflicts, humanitarian disasters, and vulnerability of people.
Twenty-six of the countries or 38 per cent made insufficient progress in reducing child mortality.
We have distorted children's physiology, since when they need us; we keep our distance; whereas when they reach the age for independence, at 14-16, we try to hang on to them.
We would like to express our gratitude to groups and individuals who offered financial support to LMCC in 1999.
Wiesje Zikkenheiner, associate expert at the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime Regional Office for Southern Africa, agreed the problem was underreported.
With the help of one of the teachers some mothers have continued to show interest in knitting.
Women could not breastfeed because of the requirements of their jobs, and so began the search for a food substitute.
Women turn to these experts as they have lost their instinctive understanding of growth, and no longer know when to wean their babies.
Zikkenheiner said recent years had seen the increased involvement of criminal organisations in human trafficking because of the extremely high profits and relatively low risks involved.
A Short Life Working Group for health, early education, social services and the voluntary sector met between December 2005 and May 2006 to examine the evidence for measures to support good infant mental health and to make recommendations for a strategy for Scotland to ensure the best outcome for all babies.
A warm, sensitive and responsive adult, Infant Mental Health: A Guide for Practitioners or small number of familiar adults is needed to guarantee the best possible outcome.
Additional research into the evidence base of effectiveness for various interventions was conducted by the Group Chair, Dr Christine Puckering, and Assistant Psychologist Jane MacQuarrie.
All would be expected to have undertaken specialist training such as the proposed  HeadsUpScotland module in Infant Mental Health.
Although there is no UK evidence of the effectiveness of BTIO in preventing teenage pregnancy, if used as part of a programme of personal and social education it could provide a valuable source of realistic feedback on the demands of caring for a young baby before child bearing.
An infant mental health video/DVD could be produced. Production costs could be reasonable with copies produced at very low cost.
Antenatal and perinatal information and services are very significant also because of their almost guaranteed contact with families.
As children's primary carers, all parents need to be supported and helped, but especially when they are parenting in difficult circumstances or facing uncertainty about the way they are bringing up their children.
As well as increasing the availability of appropriate training options, steps need to be taken to ensure that staff have sufficient time in order to attend and that their workplaces are able to release them.
Assistance should be given to parents to help them understand and appreciate the capacities of their babies as they grow and change.
Children are born physically and developmentally immature, without even the basic tools of survival.
Coordinators would promote infant mental health across agencies and disciplines and safeguard programme maintenance and fidelity.
Core training for medical and child care staff is recommended that infant mental health be made part of the core curriculum for all courses for public health nurses, undergraduate doctors, midwives, child care and child mental health professionals.
Dr Christine Puckering of the University of Glasgow was asked to convene an expert group to develop such an account.
Education for and about parenthood has in many cases been accorded low status in schools, has often had access only to poor or inappropriate resources, been seen as irrelevant by some teachers and by more academic students, particularly boys, and has sometimes been taught by teachers without the necessary commitment and skills.
Engagement of a more mature caretaker is necessary for survival but also plays a crucial role in long-term emotional, social and cognitive development.
Equally the risk may reside in the nature of the environment the baby encounters: in poverty, parental mental or physical ill health, or in the environment created by immature parents.
Even children who might be initially uninterested in discussing babies might become interested in the context of a more general framework of discussion about relationships.
Evidence of the effectiveness of psychosocial information introduced into antenatal education is poor.
Families for whom literacy is a challenge or those for whom English is not their first language may have particular needs that put their babies at additional disadvantage and also prevent easy access to resources and services.
Good parenting is fundamental for the development of a child's mental health and wellbeing.
Guide will be of interest to those working with infants, their parents and carers, and those engaged in educating children, young people and adults in issues around childcare and parenting.
Heads Up Scotland would like to thank everyone who assisted in the compilation of this report and in particular the members of the Short Life Working Group on Infant Mental Health and its Chair, Dr. Christine Puckering.
Heads Up Scotland is part of the Scottish Executive's National Programme for Improving Mental Health and Well-being.
Health visitors/public health nurses also occupy a key position in this respect.
I am pleased to be able to introduce it to you and expect that it will make an important contribution to the way we work together to improve the mental health of children and young people throughout Scotland.
If a commercial games manufacturer undertook the production and distribution of a more sophisticated game then this could have a wider and sustaining impact.
In addition, HeadsUpScotland acknowledges the research support of Jane MacQuarrie.
In all this, there are opportunities for electronic media and technology to open up access to those for whom a booklet may not be an appealing mode of receiving information.
In recent times, the Scottish Executive has taken a number of important steps designed to improve the mental health of children and young people and the services available to those in difficulty.
In the first year the making and breaking of connections between brain cells (synaptogenes is and pruning) proceeds at a rate unmatched at any other period of life.
In this way very early experience, which will not be consciously remembered, lays foundations for significant later development.
Infant Mental Health is by definition an area of early intervention both in the life of the individual child and in the possible development of difficulties.
Infants are however acutely tuned to other humans and uniquely prepared to make social connections.
Initially they were sceptical that their role had anything to do with infant mental health.
Interventions focussed during pregnancy and at the time around the birth are likely to be the most effective in preventing mental health problems of a child.
It is recommended that an infant mental health coordinator be appointed by each NHS Board.
Jane MacQuarrie and Christine Puckering made a systematic search of the literature on infant mental health resources, services and measures, with some additional literature drawn from key papers and as a result of consultations and visits.
Joint training in, for example, the Solihull Approach, should be encouraged to better equip midwives and health visitors/public health nurses in assessing families for additional supports and give greater understanding of their role in supporting infant mental health.
Joint training on infant mental health would equip professionals to deliver the right messages about the significance of early infant communication.
Lack of evidence does not prove lack of impact, but particularly for long-established programmes, there is an obligation to provide evidence of effectiveness, which could include but should not be limited to patient satisfaction.
Midwives see the vast majority of mothers-to-be and are in a unique position to enquire about and link parents to additional supports.
Midwives, health visitors/public health nurses and general practitioners are accessed by the great majority of families and each has a unique role both in supporting the best conditions for all children, and identifying those families for whom more intensive interventions may be needed.
More universal services were visited, as their approaches were often broader than a singular intervention.
NHS Board areas could explore these possibilities with local providers and infant mental health topics made part of the information available locally.
Often, risks are multifactorial and involve characteristics in the parents, the child, the fit between parent-and-child and factors in the wider environment.
Olfaction, hearing, vision and phased behaviour are all specifically orientated for face-to-face interaction from the earliest hours of life.
Once vulnerability is identified, delivery of services may pass to other agencies.
Opportunities to address infant mental health issues could arise at a number of stages in the life of the parent and the child.
Other interventions, whose degree of effectiveness is less well supported, are also detailed and the reasons for their less favored status discussed.
Particular care needs to be given to those parents who are less likely to access information or help readily.
Personal and social development in the school curriculum before pregnancy is the first opportunity and almost universally delivered.
Pre-pregnancy health improvement information is a valuable opportunity to reach a wide population, including the teenagers who will go on to become very young parents.
Prenatal services are in a very good position to reach almost every family.
Programmes should be rigorously evaluated and an evaluation strategy should be established before the programme commences.
Psychologists, psychiatrists, child psychotherapists and other professionals with a particular expertise could offer such a resource.
Reduction of teenage pregnancy rates would reduce the number of infants suffering the adverse consequences of too early parenting.
Reports, literature and evaluations were received from other services, including the Anna Freud Parent-Infant Project, the Buttercup Project, Getting Ahead and the Acorn Project.
Risks may reside in the baby, in terms of prematurity, illness, congenital and obstetric complications.
Several commercial organisations (e.g. Boots the Chemist) have online baby clubs where parents can find information and make contact.
Similar health improvement materials have been produced and used in schools as part of smoking cessation programmes at reasonable cost and if distributed to schools could provide a valuable resource.
Standards and core competencies for multi-disciplinary perinatal mental health training are currently under development and parallel standards should be developed for infant mental health.
Targeted and intensive services were considered likely to be well represented in published or “grey” literature.
The baby’s temperament and personality may also potentially create problems.
The Coatbridge investing in “Infants evaluation report” described how the community midwives had responded to Solihull Approach training.
The development of electronic games and their wide familiarity to children and young people opens up new options for introducing health education material to children and young people.
The focus was on the demonstration of impact on children and evidence-based methods of assessment for both universal to intensive treatment.
The good practices highlighted here have been evaluated by the Scottish Executive's Short Life Working Group on Infant Mental Health as those most likely to promote the improvement of infant mental health.
The group had a remit to examine models of good practice in Scotland and elsewhere for the promotion of good mental health both in low- risk and high-risk families.
The Group included representatives from statutory and voluntary sector services, policy makers, professional education, health and early education and social care sectors as these were all seen to have a role in promoting good relationships in families and particularly for infants.
The Group met on five occasions between December 2005 and May 2006. Group members presented their own services and work, and the Group reviewed health improvement materials, both printed and in audio-visual formats.
The Maternal Assessment of the Behaviour of her Infant (MABI) should be completed after birth and every week until four weeks to raise parent’s awareness.
The Mental Health of Children and Young People: A Framework for Promotion, Prevention and Care, Scottish Executive, 2005.
The opportunity to identify families with additional needs will devolve to those who deliver these services.
The opportunity to include such a programme, covering infant mental health within the umbrella of parenthood in the Personal and Social.
The popularity of games such as NINTENDOGS and now BABYZ, in which the player has to take care of animals or children, suggests that these games are accessible and interesting to quite young children.
The promotion of infant mental health requires the support of those structures through which all infants can experience optimum environments.
The work was conducted on behalf of HeadsUpScotland - the national project for children and young people's mental health.
These include interventions which improve and enhance the wellbeing of the mother and of the baby and promote the mother-infant bond.
These should include (but not be confined to) psychology, psychiatry, psychotherapy, social work and speech and language therapy.
They have given us a concise and very readable summary of the current evidence which is likely to be of interest and value to a wide range of those working with children, parents and carers and I am grateful to them.
They were also dubious about asking questions about mothers’ past and current psychological well-being, and social support, fearing that this was intrusive, and might disclose problems they did not know how to handle.
This document flows from the recommendations of the Group and the additional research.
This document, Infant Mental Health: a Guide for Practitioners is the output of the work undertaken by Dr. Puckering and her colleagues.
To help investigate this further HeadsUpScotland identified the need for a concise summary of the best evidence in relation to infant mental health.
Training for specialist CAMH professionals is recommended a specialist Infant Mental Health training module should be commissioned by HeadsUpScotland to equip specialist CAMH professionals from a variety of disciplines.
Training of all staff likely to meet new families and play a role in the care of them and their babies will reinforce a coherent approach across social work, early years practitioners, health and education.
Universal health improvement and education resources are part of this picture.
Universal services offered by Tier 1 and 2 professionals, including early years professionals, social work and voluntary organisations, should have access to specialist consultants from Child and Adolescent Mental Health for case consultation, supervision and referral if necessary.
which take into consideration the psychosocial aspects of pregnancy, promote good early parent-child interactions, attachment, support problem-solving skills of the parents, and underline the roles of fathers.
With the publication of The Mental Health of Children and Young People: A Framework for Promotion, Prevention and Care (FPPC) in October 2005, the Executive set the policy context.
Workplaces must also be able to implement any changes that are the subject of such training, including the allocation of staff time and budgets for ongoing supervision and resources, without which training alone is fruitless.
A Cochrane Collaboration review is underway to examine the effectiveness of massage for promoting mental and physical health in infants under six months but no results have so far been published.
A group-based programme was more effective when directly compared with an individual treatment programme in one study, though most studies did not make such a direct comparison.
A meta-analytic review of sixty programmes however, suggested that while effect sizes for home visiting for children under three were statistically significant.
A nurse-delivered intervention in the home at four weeks post-partum using a video tape of a baby bath relaxation technique and baby-massage demonstration led to greater involvement in the fathers in the subsequent two months.
A randomized waiting list control study is underway but an uncontrolled study showed very high rates of treatment completion in a deprived group with postnatal depression.
A second group completed the MABI at the same times but did not observe the NBAS while a third group acted as a no intervention control group.
A simple public health recommendation to bring parent and child into face-to-face orientation may also be of value.
A video-based intervention was used and the rate of insecure attachment in the high-risk group diminished as compared with untreated controls.
Although the studies varied in methodology and outcomes measured, results were positive for maternal sensitivity and infant responsiveness.
Aronen et al showed that at 20 years old, young people from high-risk families who had received 3-6 sessions of counselling in the first six months of the child’s life.
At follow-up the babies greeted their fathers with more eye contact, smiling, reaching and vocalising.
At twelve months, both intervention groups showed significantly enhanced Bayley Development Scores.
Backward facing buggies, which allow the child to watch the mother’s face, would seem a  simple example.
Bakermans-Kranenburg et al selected a group of mothers on the basis of the adult attachment style.
Bakermans-Kranenburg van IJzendoorn and Juffer made a systematic review of interventions to enhance sensitivity and attachment in early childhood covering a range of interventions from brief cognitive-behavioural programmes to long-term intensive psychosocial treatments.
Bookstart, now funded by the Booktrust and the Scottish Executive, is a very costeffective model of promoting good parent-child communication as well as having surprisingly large effects on language literacy and numeracy even into school age.
Both interaction and cognitive outcome, which at this stage is strongly related to mother-infant interaction, were improved by giving mothers the opportunity to appreciate the capacities of their babies and so to foster more responsive interactions.
Both the Brazelton plus MABI group and the MABI alone group showed enriched face to face mother and baby interaction at four months and significantly better Denver Developmental Screening Scores.
Bundles of free books for children and information for parents are distributed to parents by health visitors/public health nurses.
By two years of age the mothers in the intervention group were seen to be more involved and less punitive.
Chaffin et al described services offered to low income, high-risk for child maltreatment families.
Child outcome Data showed limited differential effects in the intervention and control groups on child behaviour problems or cognitive development at 24 months, but this varied between countries dependent on the pre-existing level of services.
Coren, Barlow and Stewart-Brown reviewed 14 studies of parenting programmes for teenage parents and their children excluding long term home support programmes.
Douglas et al., have developed the Solihull Approach for all staff working with young children.
Education, health, social services and workers and organisations from the  voluntary and statutory sectors are all in a position to deliver messages and support for infants and their families.
Evidence of the high importance for infants of communication from the earliest hours of life is becoming more emphatic.
Field et al showed the effectiveness of massage therapy for the 1-3 month infants born to depressed adolescent mothers.
Good public information and health improvement information can be made available very easily using electronic, poster and television advertising.
High drop-out and attrition rates were recorded even though most of the samples were of volunteer patients and therefore likely to be well motivated.
Home visiting has been considered the ideal model to support families with young children.
However, parental sensitivity, with a strong putative causal link to secure attachment, and attachment itself are key  markers of good infant outcome.
In a black, low educational standard group of teenage mothers with pre-term babies, this was demonstrated in front of the parent(s).
In the first trial, nurse-visited high-risk women improved their diet and reduced their smoking in pregnancy and made better use of formal and informal sources of support.
In the two years after birth home visiting continued and the intervention group had fewer non-accidental injuries and ingestions.
Including infant mental health in the training of midwives would give a positive impetus to universal infant mental health.
Inevitably, information, and the will and resources to implement recommendations will be more easily accessed by families who are best resourced in other ways.
Insecurely attached mothers were offered four home visits.
Involvement in a programme may have positive effects on other outcome measures and attrition of control groups undermines the findings of several studies.
It runs for one day a week for fourteen weeks for mothers and babies under a year.
Kangaroo care for low birth weight infants was shown to change the mother’s perception of her infant and increased mother-child responsiveness at 41 weeks gestational age.
Knowledge of the evidence, making information available to all families and providing the means to use it is an interagency responsibility.
Longer programmes also had a greater effect than those lasting less than six months.
Lengthy, intensive programmes based on a combination of sensitivity, representation and support show what the authors call “disappointingly small or even negative effects” on attachment.
Lyons-Ruth et al showed an improvement in infant development, infant attachment, mother-infant interaction, maternal depression and maternal social contacts following weekly home  visiting by either a trained lay-worker or a professional.
MacLeod and Nelson reported on a meta-analysis of child maltreatment prevention programmes, 32 of which started antenatally or in the preschool period.
Mellow Babies is a focussed programme using cognitive-behavioural interventions for the mothers and video feedback to intervene in parenting.
Midwives’ screening using interviews covering drug and alcohol use, domestic violence, and obstetric history, along with questionnaires such as the Antenatal Psychosocial Risk.
Most antenatal classes are offered in the last trimester, concentrate on delivery and are used preferentially by more middle class parents.
Mothers classified on their own attachment style as insecure-dismissing profited from video interaction guidance.
Mothers identified as having specific needs were then seen using a counselling model.
Mothers who were insecure–preoccupied tended to profit more from video feedback with  additional discussions about their childhood attachment experiences.
Onozawa, et al showed that an infant massage class improved mother infant interaction for mothers with post-natal depression.
Parents participate in 6-session antenatal groups with a psycho-social and developmental theme at around 20 weeks gestation, before the impending birth becomes imminent and all consuming.
Perinatal services are again in a strong position to reach almost every family.
Pregnancy outcomes in the replications were less clear, but maternal life-course changes and better childcare were evident.
Primary health care workers in five European countries were trained to conduct health promotion interviews with all prospective mothers one month before and one month after delivery.
Programme completers did not differ from drop-outs, or from those who only had a single contact.
Programmes combining more than one type of intervention and with an empowerment/strengths-based approach were more powerful.
Programmes helping families to meet basic needs and offering mentoring were more effective than parenting and child development programmes and clinic-based programmes were more effective than home visiting services.
Programmes involving fathers were rare, but have been shown to be positive and the need exists for greater involvement of teenage fathers who may be marginalized or neglected.
Provision to support the relationships of the mothers and their babies and protect the mental health and development of the babies is considered in the core staffing.
Scholz and Samuels is one of the few papers to address the potential for fathers to make a contribution to and enjoy the development of their infant.
Shorter and less intense programmes seemed to be as effective as longer programmes and those of 10-12 weeks were considered the most cost-effective.
Since these programmes have low cost and a large effect size (d=0.62), despite some variability, they can be highly recommended to service providers as cost-effective nterventions.
Some families will need additional support and other more intensive therapeutic interventions.
The approach is designed to meet the needs of families throughout the early development of the child, from birth to five years.
The appropriate targeting of additional support to “at risk” groups requires that mechanisms are in place to recognise who these groups are and that effective tools are made available to them.
The clinical significance of the effects was small and may not be cost-effective, although even a small reduction in child abuse risk might be considered worthwhile.
The concepts of the Integrated Assessment Framework are useful but are not linked to validated measures.
The conditions to foster good social and emotional development, which will also foster good cognitive and language development, should be promoted for all babies.
The core concepts of containment, reciprocity and behaviour management are delivered by multi-disciplinary staff and backed up with a resource pack.
The definition of a “good outcome” is also elusive, since many of the key outcome indicators will not be evident until much later in the child’s development.
The development of prenatal mental health units where mothers can be admitted accompanied by their baby is welcomed.
The European Early Promotion Project is a primary health care service to promote children’s mental health.
The families engaged in this group, held in a Sure Start family centre, have shown an increased involvement in supportive postnatal services, including Sure Start.
The Feeding Your Baby With Love video was made in close co-operation with a group of black teenage mothers who provided the content and the commentary in such a way as to ensure that the message was conveyed in culturally and age appropriate ways.
The intervention mothers were more sensitive at 13 months than were a group of control mothers.
The mothers became less depressed and observed positive interaction with their babies increased while negative interaction decreased.
The national health demonstration project Starting Well was undertaken in Glasgow, based on the Olds model.
The positive effects in the intervention group were still evident at 15 year follow-up in that unmarried poor mothers had fewer subsequent pregnancies, less time on welfare benefits and fewer criminal convictions and drug related problems.
The study showed that few differences were evident between intervention and control areas on key indices of parent-child relationships at the end of the first phase of the project.
The Sunderland Infancy Project has however been able to engage parents identified by the midwifery or health visiting service as being at risk of difficulties with their children.
The value of psychotherapeutic work at maternity and child  health centres in Stockholm has been shown to encourage a more psycho-social approach to care by case consultations, training and support offered by a psychologist to paediatric staff.
There are major difficulties in performing a meta-analysis of intensive therapeutic interventions for families with high levels of need in that few studies are set up to test effectively between treatment types, or standardise age of application or target group.
There was no relationship between programme intensity or duration and outcome.
These programmes require a minimal investment of professional time and therefore expense.
They had fewer pre-term deliveries and larger babies even among the very young teenage mothers.
They were then asked to complete the Mother’s Assessment of the Behavior of her Infant Scale (MABI) at one week intervals for the first month of the baby’s life.
This is an interesting study, but given the labour intensive nature of the Adult Attachment Interview it is not likely to have an immediate application in  clinical practice until a more economical method of recognising adult attachment style is available.
Three studies of interventions involving little personal contact between services and parents have been shown to have significant effects on maternal sensitivity and attachment with large effect sizes.
Two specific interventions have been shown to have a significant impact on later outcome.
Two studies which began in the antenatal period were particularly effective and those starting in the antenatal period or at birth were generally of greater effectiveness.
Unfortunately, randomised controlled trials of prevention and early intervention programmes have, in general, proven to be of only short term benefit in indicated groups and of little or no value in heterogeneous “at risk” populations.
We recommend that antenatal classes, particularly for vulnerable families, should be offered, for example, through Family Learning Centres or Sure Start centres at around 20 weeks gestation concentrating on infant capabilities and  parental responsiveness.
While the effect is statistically significant, the extent of the input by psychiatric nurses over five years would make this a low cost-effectiveness strategy.
Younger, less well educated and socially deprived groups are the least likely to become engaged.
A Dartmouth professor studying the chemical characteristics of an organic form of mercury – dimethyl mercury – spilled two drops of it on her gloved hand.
A diet rich in variety often provides enough protein, but because it is so vital to children, it is a good idea to provide concentrated protein sources.
A varied diet does this naturally, but learns what makes up a vegetarian “protein combination” and be sure that your child gets this in a 24 hour period.
Alternately, fortified foods or supplementation is required to meet your child’s needs.
Although they afflict widely different age groups, autism and Alzheimer’s disease share a common cause: mercury.
Another person, attempting to smelt the silver in dental amalgams he obtained (they are 35 percent silver, 50 percent mercury, and 15 percent tin, zinc, and other metals), heated them in a frying pan.
As of March 1999, the crops with the highest residues in the US were: peaches, apples, grapes, green beans, pears, spinach, and winter squash.
As vaccines for other diseases were added, health care providers began injecting increasingly larger doses of mercury into children.
Autism now afflicts 1 in 100 boys and 1 in 400 girls, and physicians diagnose 100,000 new cases of this disease every year in the U.S (using diagnostic criteria, in the DSM-IV, that is more restrictive than the previous DSM-IIIR).
Autism occurred in one out of every 350 of these children.
Autism was discovered in 1943, in American children, twelve years after ethyl mercury (thimerosal) was added to the pertussis vaccine.
Avoid wheat and nuts until after one year of age, to avoid possible food sensitivities.
B12 can only be found in animal foods, and if these are completely excluded form your diet then supplementation is necessary.
Be aware that vegetarian children are generally lighter than their omnivorous counterparts.
Both of these hormones are thought to contribute to the slow return of fertility among breastfeeding women.
Breast milk is rich in essential fatty acids, formula is not.
Breast milk should be offered for the first two years, especially to vegan children.
Breastfeeding a toddler can attract the sort of disapproval that any breastfeeding mother was subjected to a generation ago, leading some mothers to become "closet nursers".
Breastfeeding also releases endorphins, the body's natural opiates, for both mother and baby (Tay, 1991), underlining the pleasurable aspects for both partners in this amazing and rewarding relationship.
British Columbia residents take note: Produce grown in BC is subjected to a lot fewer chemicals than other provinces and countries.
Buy BC whenever it is not possible to buy organic.
Calcium sources are beans, leafy greens, figs, blackstrap molasses, fortified beverages, etc.
Chemicals accumulate in the fat of animals, such as those found in the animal's feed (pesticides, fungicides, etc.).
Currently the two most important sources of mercury exposure for Americans are dental amalgams and vaccinations.
Dettwyler notes that "In every case, regardless of the outcome health variable, the longer the child was breastfed, the better the health outcome, with the children breastfed for 18-24+ months having the lowest risk.
Dettwyler, Associate Professor of Anthropology and Nutrition at Texas AandM University has recently summarised the research on breastfeeding beyond 6 months, in a soon to be published paper.
Elemental mercury when released by a dental amalgam is inhaled and (80 percent of it) absorbed by the lungs and retained in the body.
Even in medieval times, the dangers of early weaning were understood, and sickly infants, twins and males were breastfed longer than the usual one to two years (Filds, 1995).
Even when in a solid state, combined with other metals as an alloy, mercury atoms continually escape into the atmosphere.
Extended breastfeeding also has physical benefits for mothers, partly through the release of hormones in her body as she nurses.
Finding community support can be very important in helping your child maintain healthy eating habits, as vegan diets are often misunderstood and even feared by well-meaning family members, neighbours, and teachers.
Fish harbor another organic form of mercury – methyl mercury, which is obtained from plankton that synthesizes it from inorganic mercury extracted from the sea.
For the first 6 months breast milk or formula offers all that a child needs nutritionally.
Fortified foods such as meat analogues and fortified milk substitutes provide B12.
Growing children need the materials to build a body.
He avoids eye contact and becomes strange and aloof. His vision becomes blurred; and he develops various motor disturbances, such as involuntary jerking of the arms and legs and walking on his toes.
If breast milk, dairy, or egg is included in the diet, then protein combining is usually not important.
If dairy is excluded from your child’s diet, be sure to include other calcium rich foods.
If there is a history of allergies in the family (hayfever, eczema, asthma, food allergies) exclude wheat and dairy for as long as possible, and avoid other allergens such as soy, corn , citrus, and egg.
In a typical case, shortly before his 2nd birthday a normally developing, healthy boy stops communicating with others and withdraws into himself.
In contrast, mothers in most traditional cultures breastfeed their babies into at least the second year, as did most mothers in Western Europe until this century (Dettwyler, 1995).
In general, studies support vegetarian diets for children, if proper food choices are made.
In lockstep with the government, the American Dental Association (ADA) claims that amalgams are safe, and the mercury in them poses no problem.
In the 1950s, with an immunization schedule limited to four vaccines (against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, and smallpox), 1 in 10,000 children developed this disease.
Include anoil such as flax in your child’s diet for insurance if there are no other sources being consumed regularly.
Infants and toddlers require fat for proper development.
Investigators have shown that there is a direct relationship between increasing doses of mercury in vaccines and autism.
Iron sources are grains, dried fruit, coconut milk, blackstrap molasses, soybeans, beans, etc.
Iron stores decrease at around 6 months, and breast milk has low quantities, but highly absorbable iron.
It is generally recommended that supplementation be provided as iron is so crucial in infant development.
It releases a steady stream of gaseous mercury atoms that linger in the atmosphere for months (eventually falling back to earth and its oceans in an inorganic form in rain drops).
It was at that time that I read a book called Mothering Your Nursing Toddler.
Limit meat consumption and remove all visible fat. Whole fat dairy products (milk, cheese) are also likely to contain higher residues.
Many excellent resources exist that can help educate those in your child's life who have concerns, and possibly alleviate any misconceptions they may have.
Mercury is most likely a causative factor in other developmental disorders as well, such as delayed speech and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Mercury is one proton (neutron and electron) heavier than gold – the atomic number of gold is 79; mercury, 80.
Mothers must eat essential fatty acids for their milk to have ample amounts.
My first-born, Emma, was 14 months old and I had enrolled in a course, and, with the feeling of my life opening up again, had begun to wean.
My three keen nurslings have, to me, well proven the benefits of an extended breastfeeding relationship, with a physical resilience and emotional independence that comes.
New studies published this year support her conclusions that breastfeeding is associated with higher IQ and school achievements in later childhood, with the benefit probably increasing with duration of nursing.
Norma Jane Bumgarner certainly convinced me, and Emma and I went on to nurse happily for three more years.
Only formula should be used as a substitute, soy, dairy, and other milks - even when fortified - are not suitable for infants.
Over the years I have also learned about the more tangible advantages of extended nursing.
Oxytocin, which is responsible for the let-down reflex during breastfeeding, has been called the love hormone because of its relationship to orgasm, birth, breastfeeding and bonding.
Plant proteins need to be combined to resemble the protein profile our bodies need.
Professor Dettwyler estimates, from anthropological data, that the natural age for weaning is between 4 and 6 years.
Professor Dettwyler lists the areas that have been studied so far, including: dental malocclusion, gastrointestinal disease, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, ear infections, childhood cancer and childhood diabetes.
Prolactin, sometimes known as the mothering hormone, has been shown to have a relaxing effect on the mother and to enhance the desire for contact with her baby.
Raising a child on a vegan diet can be challenging in today's world of hot-dogs and ice cream, but parents should be assured that research is on their side.
Re-reading the book six years later, her message seems less radical.
Relying on carbohydrate foods such as pasta and bread to make up the bulk of children’s diet.
Starting with the assumption that extended breastfeeding is satisfying for both mother and child, the author, Norma Jane Bumgarner writes of the security, confidence and self-esteem that we give our children when we allow them to nurse, and wean, according to their own schedule.
Studies that have indicated that it is a dangerous choice have usually focused on a sub-population that had fed their children a dangerously low calorie diet (namely macrobiotic).
Supplementation may be necessary for children who are picky eaters, but most nutritional needs can be met through diet.
The CDC and the FDA and the medical establishment, led by its specialty societies, discount or ignore this evidence – evidence that includes privately funded epidemiological studies.
The disease was not seen in Europe until the 1950s, after thimerosal was added to vaccines used there.
The Federal government’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for reasons not explained, have chosen to ignore this fact.
The first sign of mercury poisoning occurred four months later when her speech began to be slurred.
The mercury vapor thus generated killed him quickly.
The most important element of a vegetarian babies diet is breast milk.
The trend towards mothers working away from the home, the cult of the childrearing "expert", and the advice that a mother's own milk is less suitable for her baby than a scientific formula, have all contributed to the decline of extended breastfeeding.
The two other family members in the house at the time also died.
There is growing evidence, however, that mercury in vaccines and amalgams cause both autism and Alzheimer’s disease.
There is increasingly strong evidence supporting extended breastfeeding.
These agencies and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) focus exclusively on mercury in seafood, to the extent that the NIH will not fund studies that address mercury in amalgams and vaccines.
This injected organic form of mercury is readily taken up by brain and heart muscle cells.
This was followed by difficulty walking and loss of vision. She then fell into a coma and died.
Those born in 1981 were given 135 micrograms of mercury (on average), and one case of autism occurred in every 2,600 children born that year.
Today, providers follow an immunization schedule, prepared by the CDC and approved by the AAP and AAFP, that includes 13 vaccines given, with variable numbers of booster shots, 33 times before a child reaches the age of 2 (when the development of the brain is completed).
Try to limit high fibre foods and be sure to include high calorie ones (bran muffin vs avocado).
Unlike other metals, mercury, in its elemental state, is liquid (molten) at room temperature.
Vaccine makers add thimerosal (which is half ethyl mercury) to vaccines to prevent bacterial contamination.
Vegetarian moms have been found to have lower pesticide residues in their milk.
Vitamin C foods greatly enhance iron absorption, so try to include one with each meal.
Vitamin D is not a worry when your child is exposed to sunshine.
Vitamins D and B12 may be the exception, and parents should ensure an optimal supply through fortified foods or supplements.
Whether you're making a conscious decision to extend your nursing relationship or simply haven't felt the need to wean yet, you'll get support and information from your local Nursing Mothers Group.
While breastfeeding is well accepted in our culture, with around 80% of babies starting out on the breast, rates drop off quickly, with 50% still feeding at 1 month and 24% at 6 months (Australian Bureau of Stastistics).
With proper planning and a bit of self-education, parents should feel confident in giving their child a diet free of animal products.
With the addition of hepatitis B vaccine (injected on the day of birth) and one for Haemophilusinfluenzae Type b, providers injected 246 micrograms of mercury into children born in 1996.
Vaccination is the greatest discovery of the 20th century.
This is the bare minimum the child should receive.
A child can be given more than one immunization at a time
These are part of the universal immunization programme of India.
In a few places it is not possible to reach the baby at birth, for this the government has delayed the hepatitis B vaccine a little later to six weeks.
Most of the vaccines are enumerated.
Hepatitis B, DPT, polio, measles - they are very cheap vaccines and the diseases they prevent are very dreadful.
So, it’s the most economical way of preventing diseases.
The cost of managing these diseases is very high and there is risk of death as well.
You don't know how dreadful the disease is and by giving vaccination you can prevent them so easily.
People give excuses to delay for vaccination like they were very busy and couldn't spare time or the child was not well.
Here I would like to add that minor coughs and colds do not interact with the vaccination so you must take the vaccine.
Immediately after birth a few vaccines are required, like hepatitis B which is ideal to be given within the first 12 to 24 hours and now this hepatitis B vaccine is very effective in preventing hepatitis.
There should not be any excuse to delay the vaccination to child.
Most of the children do very well to vaccinations.
The vaccines are very effective and they have minor side effects.
Indian government is involved in various vaccination programmes in rural India.
In DPT there can be fever, there can be little bit of pain and can be avoided by giving paracetamol.
There are very minor side effects of vaccination.
You can go ahead and take this vaccine straight away and there is no need to repeat the whole series.
Vaccines are not 100 percent full proof, for example, MMR, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio are very effective vaccines and the efficacy is supposed to be more than 90 percent.
But vaccines are hugely effective and very good to health of any child.
MMR is a very necessary vaccine for a child.
Through vaccination child can prevent the disease, which the mother may be a carrier for and is preventable.
MMR contains three antigens i.e. measles, mumps, rubella.
Both my children have been given the hepatitis B vaccine at birth and now my children are 6 and 11 years old.
There is no need for a booster dose if a vaccine is given.
If the child has received zero dose, one month dose and six months' dose then no booster dose is required.
I have a month old baby. During birth he was given oral polio and next month we gave him DPT. Is it true that for DPT, meningitis and hepatitis B there is one vaccination?
For DPT, hepatitis B and HIB a combination vaccine is available.
HIB vaccine is a combination of hepatitis A and hepatitis B and you may combine these vaccines.
The MMR vaccine can be given after the age of 12 months as can also the chickenpox vaccine.
And MMR vaccine can be given together with a month's gap.
If the BCG nodule has formed it indicates yes, the vaccine was effective.
The baby is immune for four to six months so it is very important that mother is vaccinated too, for example, we give tetanus toxoid to the mother.
There are other markers but they are very expensive so we go by this marker.
If the child has received BCG vaccine and after four to six weeks the nodule has formed at the site of vaccination, it means the BCG vaccination has done its job.
But if there is no nodule, we wait for three months and if still there is no nodule formation, we re-vaccinate.
If there is documented proof that the two boosters have been given and in between the child gets hurts there is no need for tetanus vaccination.
The child cries after vaccination, particularly DPT, because this is one of the vaccines which can lead to a lot of crying and it is not sure that every time a child gets DPT he will cry.
Sometimes they may cry a lot and this is one of the side effects reported with DPT.
You can accept this crying as a side effect of vaccines It is not dangerous.
I have a three years old daughter. I have given her every vaccination except for chickenpox.
One of my friends told me that there is no use of the chickenpox vaccination as it is ineffective after 10 years, and he told me even if I give the vaccination my child may get infected with chickenpox.
Chickenpox is a very effective vaccine.
The reason is we want antibodies against tetanus so that these are then transferred from the mother to the baby and the baby is protected from neonatal tetanus.
The only thing is that it is a little expensive but you must give the vaccine.
It is proven that chickenpox vaccine to be very effective for almost lifelong.
Chickenpox vaccine avoids herpes zoster and those who can afford must take this vaccine.
There are prominent vaccinations for children between the ages of 10 to 15 in India.
Between the ages of 10 to 15 there is a tetanus vaccine which is given at 10 years and 15 to 16 years.
If the child has not received the hepatitis B vaccine, hepatitis A vaccine and MMR vaccine then these are the vaccines, which one can receive between 10 to 15 years.
There is a special vaccination required for a baby of NRI parents on their visit to India.
NRI babies are more prone to get water borne infections so they can take hepatitis A and typhoid vaccines before they start their journey.
If NRI babies are going to travel to those parts of India where Japanese encephalitis is present, they should also take Japanese encephalitis vaccine.
Everybody wants to know about the new MMR vaccine and it is different from the older one.
This lasts for about one or two months but this should not be an excuse to delay DPT vaccine, which contains tetanus.
The new MMR vaccine is as effective as the earlier vaccine.
MMR is a little more costly as the company claims that it has lesser side effects.
At the time of the birth my son he was given BCG vaccination on time, but no scar appeared and the same was repeated after three-four months but still no scar appeared.
Protection from preventable diseases, disabilities and death through immunization is the birth right of every child.
Immunization is one of the most cost-effective of health care interventions.
The Greek word "immune" means "to be protected".
There are two types of immunization namely active and passive.
When specific agents are introduced into the body so that it develops the needed protective response, it is called active immunization.
In passive immunization, the protective agent itself is introduced into the body.
Active immunization provides long-term protection against diseases.
Ones to be given at birth are BCG, oral polio vaccine and hepatitis B.
Passive immunization provides only short-term protection.
Infectious agents induce disease and the defence mechanisms of the body react with immunity.
First to ensure that the disease is overcome and secondly to develop protection from the disease if the same infective agent is encountered again.
A vaccine is composed of one or more inactivated parts of the infectious agent that induces a protective immune response without the risk of the disease itself.
To be successful in their protective role, vaccines should be given before the age when the infection itself is likely to occur.
In the case of tetanus, the disease cannot be prevented from occurring in the newborn baby.
So the pregnant mother is immunized and the protective agents passively pass from the mother to the foetus, thereby protecting it.
The currently used childhood vaccines do not have any interference with one another, and can therefore be used simultaneously.
The Government of India adopted the Universal Immunization Programme in 1985.
Universal Immunization Programme has been partly modified by the Indian Academy of Paediatrics, the official body of paediatricians, who look after the health needs of children.
Then at the age of six weeks' we need to give DPT with polio vaccine and hepatitis B; and then at six weeks, ten weeks and fourteen weeks.
Vaccines are now available against many other diseases.
They do not form part of the Universal Immunization Programme.
The doctor is the best person to advise whether these vaccinations need to be taken or not.
There is a, Haemophilus influenza B - HiB vaccine against bacterial meningitis.
Pneumococcus vaccines are available against pneumonia.
Meningococcus is recommended vaccine against meningitis.
Vaccines may be given by mouth like polio and typhoid vaccines; by injection into the skin or muscles.
The most commonly used site for injection is the outer aspect of the thighs.
Injections into the buttocks or the arms should be avoided.
Among the common adverse effects of various vaccines are: pain at the site of injection, low grade fever, mild rash and painful swelling of the local lymph glands
At the age of nine months we need to give the measles vaccine.
Besides these effects that may occur with several vaccines, there are some specific adverse effects of vaccines.
Patients are advised to discuss these at length with their paediatrician before vaccination.
It is unsafe to immunize a child who has a mild illness
A child with a minor illness can safely be immunized.
Children with other health problems may need to avoid certain vaccines or get them later than usual.
Children with certain types of cancers or problems with their immune systems should not get live virus vaccines like the MMR, varicella (chicken pox), or oral polio vaccines.
For children who have fits, the pertussis (whooping cough) part of the DPT vaccine may need to be delayed.
The paediatrician should be consulted in case of doubt before vaccination.
Vaccines used for routine childhood immunizations can be safely given together.
Side effects when multiple vaccines are given together are no greater than when each vaccine is given on separate occasions.
Immunization is a way of protecting the human body against infectious diseases through vaccination.
While it is the best to follow the ideal immunization schedule, on no account should the baby be denied vaccinations, even if she is brought late for them.
In addition to this campaign, conferences can be organized to effectively receive the increased demand for the measles vaccination.
But every attempt must be made to complete full immunization, before the age of 1 year.
My friend's baby, who was given the B.C.G. injection about two months ago, has developed a small blister at the site of injection.
Please reassure your friend that there is no cause for worry.
There is a normal reaction after the B.C.G. injection.
About 4 to 6 weeks after B.C.G. injection a small lump called a papule appears at the injection which may later break, giving out a whitish discharge.
This will heal in about 10 to 12 weeks after the injection has been given and will leave a scar.
Only if the discharge continues without the wound drying up, should the doctor be consulted.
There are few side effects of vaccinations against children.
Only very few infants and children develop side effects after a vaccination.
Immunization prepares our bodies to fight against diseases in case we come into contact with them in the future.
After the D.P.T. injection, the infant may have pain at the site of the injection and may even develop fever.
In that case the baby may be given 1/2 a table or 1/2 a tsp. of paracetamol.
After the measles injection, measles like rashes may appear.
Very rarely, children can have allergic reactions straight after immunization.
Also if the baby develops high fever or loses consciousness, a doctor should be consulted immediately.
People giving immunizations are trained to deal with allergic reactions and if the child is treated quickly, he or she will recover fully.
Sometimes it is not possible to take the baby for the second and third vaccinations after precisely a month.
Continue the vaccinations as per the schedule and complete the course as soon as possible.
The child will be fully protected only after she has received 1 B.C.G. injection.
3 D.P.T. injections, 3 O.P.V. doses and 1 measles injection.
Babies are born with some natural immunity which they get from their mother and through breast-feeding.
Hence it is very important to take the baby for the vaccination at the correct time and to make sure that all the vaccinations are given.
There are very few reasons why a child should not be immunized.
Ordinarily common illnesses like a cold or a diarrhea are not impediments against getting your child vaccinated.
There are certain situations though, where you must let your healthcare provider know of your child’s conditions.
We know that vaccines are safe for our children to avoid them illness.
Vaccines like all other medicines undergo extensive and rigorous tests regarding their safety.
Only after they have been found to be safe that they are introduced for general vaccination programs.
Each vaccine is continually checked even after it has been introduced and action is taken if it is needed.
If a vaccine is not safe for children and adults, it is not used.
With a host of new vaccines now available, vaccination is no more the simple decision that it once was.
This gradually wears off as the baby's own immune system starts to develop.
If you’ve been part of the animated discussions at schools and playgrounds about whether to give your child a particular shot or not you’ll know exactly what I mean.
Conflicting advice from peers, elders in the family and aggressive television notices doesn’t help.
What complicates matters further is when pediatricians have diverse views.
Doctors have different opinions and finally it’s up to mothers to decide whether or not to give the extra shots.
It’s tough for parents to make these decisions and then follow through diligently, especially if they have several children, move frequently, change doctors, or are on a limited budget.
First and foremost, it’s important to recognize that vaccines are good and most of them provide life-long immunity.
A vaccine has to be judged on whether it’s safe and effective, and those available are good, otherwise they wouldn’t be marketed.
In spite of this, vaccines have been unintentionally placed into different categories.
The Indian Academy of Pediatrics advocates more four more vaccines that those in the National Immunization Schedule and the Academy itself has placed two more under the category of ‘additional’ vaccines.
Once we know why a vaccine falls into a particular category its easier to make the decision whether to take it or not.
Having your child immunized gives extra protection against illnesses which can kill.
The National Immunization Schedule makes BCG (prevents tuberculosis), OPV (prevents Polio), DPT (prevents Pertussis, Diphtheria and Tetanus) and the Measles vaccines mandatory.
All these are serious diseases except for Measles, but children with Measles can develop complications like bronchitis.
These vaccines are inexpensive and are given free of cost by the government.
While the Indian Academy of Pediatrics fully supports the National Immunization Schedule, it acknowledges that it ‘provides for only the basic minimum immunization needs of Indian children’.
The government can afford certain vaccines at this period of time and individuals can afford the other vaccines.
However, affordability can become an even larger issue if the parents feel that a vaccine is not mandatory.
Cost is a large contributory factor towards resistance to vaccines.
Another problem – the fear of the needle – is also a key factor.
Combine these two factors with parental lethargy and lack of exigency and vaccination dates are missed or avoided altogether.
Hepatitis B shots (three injections in all) are considered a must by pediatricians as Hepatitis B is a dreaded liver disease, more infectious than HIV.
The schedule recommends that that the vaccinations should start when the baby is 1 1/2 months old.
MMR is also strongly recommended, includes the Mumps and Rubella vaccine, in addition to Measles.
Rubella is a dreaded disease for pregnant women as it can damage the fetus.
Typhoid, endemic water borne disease can be treated, but if it’s contracted by the child during examinations, it can turn into a parents’ worst nightmare.
The vaccination process is pretty simple - a single injection.
An oral typhoid vaccine is also available, although several doses are needed.
The disadvantage is that the typhoid vaccine has to be repeated every three years and parents often balk at this.
My doctor says that as we aren’t in the high risk group, we can give it when the child is in the 9th as it protects the child during the 10th and 12th.
The Hib vaccine kills the pathogens causing meningitis and pneumonia in infants and small children.
The Hib disease is age dependent and has to be given before the age of five years, not later.
The ‘additional’ vaccines recommended by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics are for Hepatitis A and Chicken Pox.
But what should be done if the baby is brought late for vaccinations?
However the severity of the diseases increases with age and many pediatricians insist on vaccination for teens.
The issue of seasonality of vaccines is relevant in the case of vaccines which offer short-term protection like Typhoid or influenza vaccines.
Typhoid is common in summer and the monsoons, and it’s useful to give it before the start of the ‘season’.
The influenza vaccine is not easily available in India.
Influenza vaccine changes from year to year, depending on the changing viruses and many doctors doubt it’s efficacy, as it depends on whether the anti-bodies against the prevalent strain have been used in it’s manufacture.
More than anything, vaccines should be given in time, before the age at which the infection is anticipated.
Cost should not matter for the educated and affluent as most of these vaccines cost a few hundred rupees or less (except for the chickenpox vaccine which costs Rs. 1500/-), and are all very safe, with hardly any side-effects.
Side-effects of vaccines are usually temporary, and rarely do they cause a severe reaction.
If by chance your child misses a dose, don’t worry.
It makes no difference if the shot is given late and if by mistake a dose is repeated as there is no evidence that this is harmful.
Baby is brought late for vaccinations should vaccination still be started.
If you can afford a particular vaccine, take it, after consultation with your doctor.
Because of the strong relationship between measles and serious diarrhoea, and the effectiveness of measles vaccine, immunization against measles is a very cost-effective measure for reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with diarrhoea.
Measles vaccine given at the recommended age can prevent up to 25% of diarrhoea-associated deaths in children under 5 years of age.
However, in India, there are still _____ percent of children who are not immunized against measles.
A team of researchers will investigate the key points related to why many children are not receiving a measles immunization within the first year of their life.
There is an adequate supply of the measles vaccination for all children within their first year of life in the state of Maharashtra.
the necessary coordination occurring within the health delivery system to provide the vaccination to children within the first year of their life
Health care providers are aware of the importance and necessity of a measles vaccination to all children to reduce child mortality, and the importance of receiving this immunization within the first year of a child's life
Mothers are aware of the importance and necessity of a measles vaccination to all children within their first year of life.
Through a multi-tiered investigation of why all children are not receiving a measles immunization within the first year of their life, a program will be designed to provide the vaccination to children.
Even if the baby is brought late for vaccinations, she should still receive all the vaccinations.
The program aim will be to provide 100 % immunization coverage against measles to children within their first year of life.
Health workers will play a crucial role in the anticipated social marketing of measles immunization for child survival.
The health workers will serve as the "sales force" to sell the knowledge and importance of a measles vaccination within the first year of a child's life to mothers.
In order to do this, they must be fully educated about the product they are promoting--its benefits and costs--and be sensitive to the concerns of mothers.
The knowledge gained from the investigation about why (how many) children are not currently being immunized against measles within their first year of life will be analyzed and applied to design a program increasing vaccination coverage.
This program will include a campaign that promotes a single day of the week for free measles vaccinations.
Through demand creation activities such as TV and radio broadcasts, and print materials, mothers will be informed about the special opportunity on a designated day of the week for a free measles vaccination.
This tactical information will be combined with a thematic message about the danger of measles.
As part of this program, extended hours of local health centers will be advertised.
Focusing a mother's attention on a specific day will encourage her to think about her child's immunization status and take action.
Generally, live-virus vaccines are contraindicated for pregnant women because of the theoretical risk of transmission of the vaccine virus to the fetus.
MMR and its component vaccines should not be administered to women known to be pregnant.
Thimerosal is a preservative, so it's used in vaccines that are stored in vials (containers) that have more than one dose.
Although no adverse effects of OPV or IPV have been documented among pregnant women or their fetuses, vaccination of pregnant women should be avoided.
MMR and its component vaccines should not be administered to women known to be pregnant.
Although no evidence exists that tetanus and diphtheria toxoids are teratogenic, waiting until the second trimester of pregnancy to administer Td is a reasonable precaution for minimizing any concern about the theoretical possibility of such reactions.
The effects of the varicella virus vaccine on the fetus are unknown; therefore, pregnant women should not be vaccinated.
Although no harmful effects to the fetus have been associated with BCG vaccine, its use is not recommended during pregnancy.
For most of us, hepatitis does not ring any alarm bells, despite the fact that this disease has the potential of becoming as explosive as HIV.
While most health-related agencies like to brush aside hepatitis as a non-issue, data forces you to believe otherwise.
In India, while nearly 30 lakh people have been tested as HIV-infected, nearly 3.5 per cent of the population is reported to be Hepatitis B positive and 1.5 per cent Hepatitis C positive.
In other words, India has more than 450 lakh carriers of the B and C strains of hepatitis alone.
Whether live or inactivated vaccines are used, vaccination of pregnant women should be considered on the basis of risks vs. benefits – i.e., the risk of the vaccination vs. the benefits of protection in a particular circumstance.
The threat, however, lies in the fact that each one of these carriers can infect countless other people without showing any symptoms or illness themselves.
The hepatitis B and C viruses harm the liver the most and are responsible for a chunk of the cases of cancer of the liver and cirrhosis reported our country.
Treatment apart, the only cost-effective method of controlling Hepatitis B would be to break the cycle of the virus.
Hepatitis B can be nipped in the bud, as it is the only stain which can be transmitted from the mother to the child.
The contribution of perinatal (from mother to child) transmission of hepatitis is very significant in India.
Hepatitis can be prevented either by vaccinating children or by preventing infection in expectant mothers.
Surprisingly, barring a few hospitals, the staffs of most hospitals and nursing homes are not vaccinated.
As far as breaking the cycle of the virus is concerned, India will have to follow the example of the over 80 countries who have already vanquished the virus through mass immunization or vaccinating children below one year of age.
The government has worked out the cost for the immunization to about Rs. 350crore.
In the latter cases, the child cannot be vaccinated within 48 hours of birth.
The safety of hepatitis A vaccination during pregnancy has not been determined; however, because hepatitis A vaccine is produced from inactivated [hepatitis A virus], the theoretical risk to the developing fetus is expected to be low.
If vaccinated later than that, the result of the vaccination is not as effective.
This defeats the very purpose of mass vaccination.
Another aspect which needs attention is that expectant mothers should be monitored more carefully because if a baby less than a year old gets infected with Hepatitis B through the mother, there are 90 per cent chances of chronic infection, and 25 per cent chance of death due to a liver disease.
More than 90 per cent of these infections can be prevented if HBV-infected mothers are identified and their infants vaccinated.
Hepatitis B vaccination and one dose of HBIG, (the immunologic substance which acts as immediate first aid in case the infection is transmitted from the mother to the child), administered within 24 hours of birth, are 85 to 95 per cent effective in preventing both HBV infection and the chronic carrier state.
Hepatitis B vaccine administered alone in three or four dose schedule, beginning within 24 hours of birth, is 70 to 95 per cent effective in preventing the infection from passing from the mother to the baby.
Of course, the additional reduction in acute hepatitis B and hepatitis B- associated chronic liver diseases resulting from mass infant vaccination can become apparent only after a number of years.
The golden rule is earlier the detection and vaccination; greater are the chances of survival.
In case the child has not been vaccinated and develops the infection as he grows, the cost of treatment works up to lakhs.
Still, the chances of the child getting rid of the infection are only 50 to 60 per cent.
The risk associated with vaccination should be weighed against the risk for hepatitis A in women who may be at high risk for exposure to [hepatitis A virus].
This makes it all the more important to either prevent or nip the infection in the bud.
Vaccination is the best way to protect your child against dangerous diseases.
Children in Canada are routinely vaccinated against many serious illnesses, including diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), polio, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), measles, mumps, rubella and hepatitis B.
Several new vaccines are now available to protect against chickenpox (varicella), pneumococcal and meningococcal diseases, as well as diseases caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and rotavirus gastroenteritis (a common cause of severe diarrhea in children under 3 years).
Influenza (flu) vaccine is recommended for children older than 6 months.
Not all of these vaccines are covered by every provincial or territorial health plan.
It is important that your child receive all the vaccines (“shots”) recommended in the childhood immunization schedule.
The timing for these shots may be slightly different depending on where you live.
dTp vaccine for adolescents: protects against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough).
Pneumococcal vaccine: Protects against infections caused by Streptococcus pneumonia, including meningitis (a brain infection), pneumonia, and ear infections.
On the basis of limited experience, there is no apparent risk of adverse effects to developing fetuses when hepatitis B vaccine is administered to pregnant women.
Meningococcal vaccine: Protects against diseases caused by the meningococcus bacteria, including meningitis and septicemia, a serious blood infection.
HPV vaccine: Protects girls from several types of HPV that cause cervical cancer and genital warts.
The CPS recommends that all children over 6 months old get a flu shot each year.
The vaccine is especially important for children who are at high risk of complications from the flu.
These are children with heart or lung problems (like cystic fibrosis or asthma), a chronic condition like diabetes, or have to be treated for long periods of time with ASA (Aspirin).
You should also speak to a physician about vaccines that can protect your child while travelling.
Vaccines are generally very safe and there are rarely reasons not to get vaccinated.
If your child had an allergic reaction to a vaccine—such as breathing problems, severe swelling of the skin or mouth—talks to your doctor before the next shot.
With any vaccine, there may be some redness, swelling or pain at the place where the needle went into the arm or leg.
Some children may have a fever after a vaccine.
The vaccine contains non-infectious HBSAG particles and should cause no risk to the fetus [Hepatitis B virus] infection affecting a pregnant woman may result in severe disease for the mother and chronic infection for the newborn.
If your child is very sick when it’s time for a vaccine, talk to your doctor.
If your child has a severe egg allergy (hives, swelling of the eyes, face or mouth), she should only be given the flu vaccine under close medical supervision.
Most of the vaccine is made in chicken eggs.
Give your baby sugar water (with a teaspoon or pacifier) just before the shot, or nurse your baby while he gets the needle.
Use distractions (blow bubbles, read a book), suggest deep breathing, remain calm and physically comfort your child (cuddle, hold hands) during the needle.
If your child is crying or fussy after getting the shot, you can give her acetaminophen.
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) requires a series of immunizations.
The exact number and timing of each may vary with the type of vaccine used.
Two-dose programs for MMR are given in all territories and provinces.
Second dose MMR is given either at 18 months or 4-6 years of age.
Therefore, neither pregnancy nor lactation should be considered a contraindication to vaccination of women.
Recommended schedule and number of doses of meningococcal vaccine depends on the age of the child.
Type C vaccine is now given routinely to babies.
A new vaccine covering types A, W-135, Y as well as C is also available.
This vaccine is not currently recommended for routine use in Canada, but is used for people at higher risk of getting meningococcal infection.
Talk to your doctor or public health nurse if you have questions about vaccines or your child’s health.
Immunization is one of the most important ways to keep your child healthy.
Before many of today’s vaccines were available, children often got very sick or even died from diseases that can now be prevented.
Like all medicines, vaccines must go through a series of steps before they are approved for use.
Vaccines must be shown to be safe and effective in preventing the diseases they target.
Once a vaccine is in use, health authorities continue to ensure that it is safe.
Pregnant women who have medical conditions that increase their risk for complications from influenza should be vaccinated before the influenza season—regardless of the state of pregnancy.
One way is through a unique program called IMPACT (Immunization Monitoring Program, Active).
Canada also has a system where any doctor or nurse can fill out a report to Health Canada if they have a patient with a serious health problem that occurred after vaccination.
After a vaccine, some children may have a fever or may feel pain where the needle went into the arm or leg.
Taking acetaminophen before or after a vaccination can help.
The chance of getting sick from the disease far outweighs the very small risk of reacting to an immunization.
It is better to give vaccines one at a time or combined with others.
Many of the shots your child will receive have several vaccines in them, such as the 5-in-1 vaccine (which protects against diphtheria, polio, tetanus, pertussis and Haemophilus influenzae type B or Hib disease).
The MMR vaccine (which protects against measles, mumps and rubella).
A number of studies have shown that giving combinations of vaccines is both safe and effective.
It’s also practical, allowing your child to receive several vaccinations during the same visit.
MMR and its component vaccines should not be administered to women known to be pregnant.
Fewer shots may also be less traumatic for your child.
The reason that vaccination starts at 2 months of age is to protect babies against pertussis and Hib disease as early in life as possible, since these diseases are more harmful to young babies.
There is no evidence that side effects from vaccination are more common in younger infants.
There is NO scientific evidence to support this theory that measles or MMR vaccine causes autism or other developmental disorders.
All the research on the MMR vaccine and autism has been reviewed independently by expert committees who agree that there is no scientific evidence that MMR causes autism, autistic spectrum disorders or inflammatory bowel disease.
In the past, mercury was present in some vaccines in the form of thimerosal.
Thimerosal is an organic mercury compound that has been used as a preservative in some vaccines and other medications since the 1930s.
There is no evidence that the presence of thimerosal in vaccines causes brain damage in children.
Large studies in which some children received vaccines containing thimerosal and received thimerosal-free vaccines showed no difference in the number of children who developed autism.
As of March 2001, all vaccines for routine immunization of children in Canada and the United States are produced without thimerosal.
Common triggers include colds or flu, tobacco smoke, exercise and allergies to things like pollen, furry or feathery animals or house-dust mites.
Some people may have to change parts of their lifestyle because of worsening asthma symptoms.
It can be difficult to identify exactly what triggers your asthma.
Sometimes the link is obvious, for example when your symptoms start within minutes of coming into contact with a cat or pollen.
Some people have a delayed reaction.
By avoiding the triggers that make your asthma symptoms worse, and by taking your asthma medicines correctly, you can reduce unnecessary symptoms and continue to enjoy your usual lifestyle.
There are some excellent treatments available to help you to control your asthma.
The most effective way of taking most asthma treatments is to inhale the medicine so it goes straight into your lungs.
There are a variety of inhalers available and it is important that you use a device that you are comfortable with and which can be used properly.
Your doctor or nurse will advise you on the most appropriate device and should demonstrate how to use it correctly.
When a person with asthma comes into contact with an asthma trigger, the muscle around the walls of the airways tightens so that the airway becomes narrower.
There are two main types of asthma medicine relievers and preventers.
Reliever inhalers are usually blue and you take them to relieve symptoms.
They work quickly by relaxing the muscles surrounding the narrowed airways.
They are essential in treating asthma attacks.
If you need to use your reliever inhaler 3 times a week, you should go back to your doctor or nurse and have your symptoms reviewed so that they can be kept under control.
Preventers usually come in brown, red or orange inhalers.
They work by controlling the swelling and inflammation in the airways, stopping them from being so sensitive and reducing the risk of severe attacks.
They build up over a period of time so they need to be taken every day, usually morning and evening, even when you are feeling well.
Most preventers contain a steroid medicine.
It is important to understand that it is not the same as anabolic steroids used by athletes to improve their performance.
The lining of the airways becomes inflamed and starts to swell.
There are other types of medicine that can be added to your reliever and preventer inhaler if needed, such as preventer tablets and long-acting relievers.
For information about new medicines that may be more effective for you, speak to your doctor or nurse.
Many people with asthma use a preventer that contains a low dose of inhaled steroid.
The steroids used to treat asthma are corticosteroids a copy of the steroids which is produced naturally in your body.
They are completely different from the anabolic steroids used by bodybuilders and athletes.
Inhaled steroids go straight down to the airways, so very little is absorbed into the rest of the body.
Your doctor will prescribe the lowest possible dose.
Children should be monitored closely, especially for growth.
Occasionally, if your asthma symptoms become severe, your doctor may give you a short course of steroid tablets.
They work quickly and powerfully to help to calm down your inflamed airways.
Often sticky mucus or phlegm is produced.
Short courses of tablets, anything from 14 days, will not give any long-term side effects.
Steroid tablets can lower the body's resistance to chickenpox, so you should contact your doctor if you are taking steroid tablets and come into contact with chickenpox.
Most preventer treatments contain steroids and taking them through an inhaler means that a much lower dose of the steroid can be used and because the inhaled medicine goes straight down to the airways where it is needed, very little is absorbed into the rest of the body.
When steroids are taken in tablet form the dose is much higher (one steroid tablet gives 50 times the dosage of a puff from a standard steroid inhaler) and most of it will be absorbed into the rest of the body, not just your lungs.
Using steroid tablets regularly for long periods of time (months or years) can have serious side effects such as brittle bones (osteoporosis), bruising, diabetes, cataracts, increased hunger, heartburn and indigestion.
They may make you feel depressed, or have mood swings or have a fattened face (moon face).
To help you to control your asthma symptoms, your doctor or nurse should discuss with you the best way you can control your symptoms and as part of this, should give you a written record of your asthma medicines and what to do if your symptoms get worse.
During your review, ask them for an asthma medicine card and a personal asthma action plan.
Take two puffs of your reliever (blue) inhaler, Sit up and loosen tight clothing.
If no immediate improvement is felt during an attack, continue to take one puff of reliever inhaler every minute for five minutes or until symptoms improve.
All these reactions cause the airways to become narrower and irritated leading to the symptoms of asthma.
For confidential and independent advice about asthma, phone the Asthma UK Advice line to speak to our asthma nurse specialists through an interpreter.
The mythology of cancer includes such facts as, that cancer is caused by an agent, ( and hence can be prevented by ridding humanity of that agent), that it can be diagnosed at a stage when a pre-emptive strike at it would assure a cure, and that these are the only essentials that need bother us about the nature of cancer.
Never in the history of mankind has so much untruth been told so often by so few to so many, for so long, at such a backbreaking fiscal and human cost.
The mythology of the whole field of cancerology is best summed up as colossal ignorance matched by over claiming, overdoing and overpromising.
Our ignorance starts with the apparently simple problem of defining cancer.
Cancer experts over claim to breed illusions of knowledge of the cause of cancer.
Despite the fact that not one cause (including smoking), advanced by them as responsible for the occurrence of a cancer, has ever proved to be the sine qua non of that cancer, cancerology continues to hold everything under the sun, including the sun itself, as cancerogenic.
The outcome of it all is cancerophobia, a disease (aptly described by Ingelfinger, the late editor of the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine as) as serious as cancer itself , and morally far more devastating.
Cancerologists overdo - overdiagnose and overtreat - because they refuse to accept the writing on the wall that no cancer can be diagnosed early enough, or can be treated to the point of a cure: the cancer therapist treats what he sees.
The illusion of a cure following therapy lies mainly in the patient not feeling the presence of cancer and / or the clinician not being able to detect it.
The common symptoms of asthma are coughing, wheezing or a whistling noise in the chest, getting short of breath, a tight feeling in the chest.
It is most likely that, in terms of life expectancy, the chance of survival is no better with than without treatment, and there is the possibility that treatment may make the survival time of cancer cases less.
This cancer occurs just beneath the skin.
Its natural history has been studied for centuries.
It is one of the most amenable tumours to self-examination, clinical examination, staging, grading, hormone therapy, and what have you.
Breast cancer, as a paradigm, typifies the utter failure of cancerology.
Left to cancerologists, it never will.
In a subtle way, cancer societies manipulate minds.
The whole public image of cancerology, Burnet sums up, is one of humanitarianism, but not of biological scholarship.
The insurmountable reality about cancer is that it is not amenable to science, being, what Weinberg calls, trans-science.
All the accessible and analyzable facets of cancer - cell, tumour, treatment, cause and prevention, genetics, its very raison detre - for one reason or another, do not lend themselves to prediction by what we know or can do.
Asthma can start at any age.
Set below are the various points / counterpoints vis-a-vis each of the above facets.
Cancer Cell Put in Shakespearean style: a cancer cell is, for a person,an ill-favoured thing, sir (Mr Researcher), but mine own.
It, therefore, emerges and multiplies like any other cell, and it falls prey to cytotoxic agents - drugs, X-rays - with no greater willingness than other normal cells of the body.
By this one feature of selfsameness, the cancer cell has as it were cured itself, once and for ever, of any selective action by radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
A cancer cell carries in itself an indelible stamp of its own uniqueness - rendering itself neither susceptible to a specific drug nor preventable by a vaccine.
Cancer cells are, in the human or animal body, in an inexhaustible supply.
It is little wonder that patients with acute leukaemia, even when bombarded with heavy doses of cell poisons over protracted periods, are never free of leukaemia cells.
This is a classic example of the cancer realistic fact that whilst some cancer cells can be destroyed, a cancer itself cannot be.
A cancer cells faculty of leaving its site of origin and migrating elsewhere is predetermined, individualistic, and unpredictable.
The uncertainty and individuality surrounding a cancer cell rule out the creation of a cancer-cell-model.
A trigger is anything that irritates the airways and causes the symptoms of asthma to appear.
Like matter, a cancer cell defies being defined.
The best we can do is to paraphrase an academic circumlocution on matter.
Cancer cell is, what it is, For it does, what it does, and it does, what it does; For it is, what it is.
The above lines amplify Smither's generalization that a cancer cell is no distinct structural entity, but an organ of behaviour.
The same could be said of the overall phenomenon of cancer.
The aim of tumour research (clinical cancer research) is, a la Kipling, to know the what, why, when, how, where and who of tumour formation, in a patient with cancer.
A clinician, with all his gadgets, is only wiser after the event.
For him to know the when of a tumour is impossible whether the patient presents himself for the first time, or after having been treated.
All experienced pathologists know that every tumour exhibits its own individuality of microscopic structure.
The why and how belongs to acausalism, canceration and tumour-formation being integral parts of life.
Everyone's asthma is different and you will probably have several triggers.
Much as a Үormal cell and all its manifestations are a mystery to us, so are a cancer cell and its manifestations.
The what, where and who are predictable certainties at the herd level, but only probabilities at the individual level.
The epidemiologic concept of probability can be best amplified by acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a form of blood cancer.
Globally, it occurs at the rate of two or three cases per 100,000 populations per year with little variation from country to country.
An earlier event in this sequence is not necessarily followed by the next one.
The scare-mongering statistics by cancer societies are generally based on the assumed invariable progression along the above sequence of events.
The lack of such inevitable progression, in fact, invalidates the so-called animal-tumour- model used in the laboratory so far.
The cardinal error of the cancer-must-be-treated dogma is the assumption that a patient survives or feels better because of and not despite the treatment.
A surgeon who paid a heavy price for such a dogma depicted his experiences in a personal account of the after-effects of the modern treatment of carcinoma.
This 1938 article has undiminished relevance in 1994.
All therapies come on the scene when the silent spread of cancer is a fait accompli.
Successes gained in test tubes have remained restricted to the test tubes only.
The implication is that one would have done these men no favour by treating them for a disease that was not causing them any problem'.
It makes it clear that cancerology has been searching for a cause that never was.
What has no cause can have no prevention either.
Cancer is an eminent vertebrate feature that functions at the herd level, mediated by multifactorila inheritance.
The unreasoning dictates of heredity have been epitomized in the Gaussian dictum - Damnosa hereditas.
It is the corporate gene pool of a herd that determines which type of cancer - nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Chinese populations and leukaemia in Jews, around the world - would occur, in which individuals of the herd, and at what different ages.
The occurrence of cancer in an individual person is governed not just by his genes but by their corporate interaction with the herd gene pool, a realization that makes cancer not a matter of heredity but heredity (herd-ity), and a phenomenon most certainly beyond the ken of genetics - to be candid, trans-genetics.
Modern genetics has given up its one-gene-one-character concept, accepting that a single character is controlled by many genes, and vice versa.
Which of a human cell's 100,000 genes controls the conversion of such a cell into a cancerous one is unknown, more so since the precise definition of gene itself is unknown.
Any attempts at locating cancer gene/s are fraught with problems that are beyond the science of genetics.
Surgery can promote the spread of cancer, most other therapies promote the occurrence.
Burnet has alluded to the current illusion that what can happen in E.Coli can also be made to happen in an elephant.
Cure of cancer through gene- manipulation is as tall an order as that.
Raison d'etre of CancerThe late Leslie Foulds emphasized the need for contemplative research on cancer - to understand it more, than to conquer it.
The truth is that we already have more "facts" than anybody knows what to do with.
And the incontrovertible facts that we do have, are enough to carry us all towards an understanding of cancer.
The result, therefore of all this research has been essentially unhelpful towards the elucidation either of the cause or the cure of cancer.
Contemplative cancer research requires three qualities - the humility to consider man on par with other animals, the comprehensive approach of a generalist and from these two, the acceptance of cancer as a part of living, and dying.
Cancer is researchable, but only at the level of understanding.
Environmentally, their conditions appear to be the same.
What is so interesting is that we find some cancers more common in certain groups of people than in other groups living in almost identical circumstances.
Cancer therapies may ease life, but do not prolong survival, no matter given when and how.
Summarizing, one could say that cancer is, even at the human level, a discernible universal feature that is independent of the presumed cancerogens, and is impartial in its global sway.
Though you drive Nature out with a pitch-fork, she will find her way back to triumph in stealth over your foolish contempt.
The intrinsicality of cancer implies that it is the individual's developmental programme that determines whether a cancer would occur.
If it is not a part of his programme, nothing can cause it; if it is, nothing can prevent it.
Cancer springs from one's own flesh and blood.
This very fact renders the above Horatian aphorism relevant to human cancer.
All therapies put together cannot drive out Nature, manifesting itself as human cancer.
Man and animals are four-dimensional entities, with time as the fourth dimension.
In the words of Portmann, animal life, from its very start as a zygote formed by the union of the sperm and the ovum, is configured time.
Put simply, all bodily changes of growth and decay occur along a pre- set programme, the programme unfolding with the passage of time.
In the case of chronic lymphatic leukaemia and breast cancer, the mortality rate is independent of the duration of disease.
It is this time-governedness of cancer which determines the occurrence of an esophageal cancer in a boy aged fourteen years, or a man, aged ninety-four years.
The time of such occurrence is normally distributed.
Portmann, talking of insect metamorphosis, observes that the specific formation of the mature organism is prefigured in the egg, though in what way we do not yet know,'
Foulds refers to such pre-programming by animal life as a decision in advance of performance.
Cancer is a temporal process, its programme already embedded in an individual and manifesting itself on the aging of the individual.
The pre-programming is once again akin to what Foulds describes as the general phenomena of decision in advance of performance, both affirmatively and negatively.
The former is exemplified by a puritanical non-smoker ending up with a lung-cancer and the latter by a chain smoker smoking his way joyfully into his nineties without any cancer, of the lung or elsewhere.
A corollary of cancer being a part of the temporal unfolding of an individual is that like the unidirectional time-arrow, it is irreversible.
Senescence takes a generally similar form in each species, whether judged by the physico-chemical changes in collagen, the incidence of degenerative changes in blood vessels or the high incidence of malignant disease.
The essence surely is that there is a genetic "programme in time" laid down for each species.
Thus it is reasonable to expect that even a very effective chemotherapeutic agent would not improve the survival of patients with either of these diseases; indeed, it has so far not been possible to demonstrate any effect of chemotherapy on survival.
There must be a biological clock and a means by which a series of processes can be made to occur earlier or later according to the expediencies of evolutionary survival.
The pantrajectorial occurrence of cancer, from intra-uterine life to old age in man, has prevented it from being called a senescent process, as such a process for reasons etymologic, is expected to occur only in a senile individual.
Senescence has been defined as an intrinsic process that increases the probability of the death of an individual.
Cancer, at whatever age it occurs, is an intrinsic process that increases the probability of death, whether it be in a child of two years or in a man of eighty years.
In fact, its function of heightening the probability of death is more severe when it affects a young individual.
In an old person, multiple, mild or moderate senescent processes produce an effectively lethal aggregate.
Strehler has put down, as criteria of senescence, intrinsicality, progressiveness and deleteriousness.
Now, a child dying of cancer dies of a senescent process.
It dies of a process that was intrinsic, deleterious and progressive and which when the child was alive had contributed to the increased probability of death.
Summarizing, the hypothesis that cancer is an intrinsic, time- governed, senescent process is a gestalt view on the nature of cancer.
This point was recently reemphasized for acute myeloblastic leukaemia of adults.
The intrinsicness does not admit of a cancerogen.
The temporal nature accounts for the occurrence of cervical cancer in a young girl, and in a woman of seventy years; the time-governedness does not permit regression of cancer, a corollary fully substantiated by cancerology; the temporal nature allows the so-called cancerogen to be, more truly, a cancer-preponer.
Cancer's senescent nature places it as one of the numerous pre-death forces; the senescent nature excludes cancer as being necessarily a lethal process.
Foulds has deplored the popular usage of  military terminology' for cancer, like calling it killer, slayer, enemy and so on.
The compelling reason for not calling cancer by such epithets is the confounding fact that, so often, an evident cancer cannot be held responsible for a person's death.
On the basis of vast survival data of cancers treated and untreated, Waterhouse was inspired to suggest that the diagnosis of cancer should not deprive a person of the benefit of insurance on his life.
Many an older individual with chronic leukaemia dies with the disease.
Jones has alluded to the undefined physiological systems that produce death of the patient, and along with him or her, of the cancer.
They have nothing to do with human or animal cancers.
Cancer is Trans-scientific.
The liver cell is more like a typical cell, with no morphological features that make it extraordinary.
Yet, it is  an extremely advanced industrial chemical plant.
The liver cell has been cited here to emphasis the point Smithers made about the cancer cell - both have no definable structural entities, and are only organs of behaviour.
Liver cells from different animals look and behave similarly; cancer cells don't.
Every time a cancer is formed, speciation occurs - a new species is formed as it were, unprecedented, unparalleled and unrepeatable.
Cancerology's outstanding limitation is its ignorance on its legit motif - the cancer cell.
Weinberg calls a question  trans-scientific' when it can be asked of science, but which cannot be answered by science; such a question transcends science.
The causality / curability of cancer are one such question.
This dissociation may be realized from the fact that natural or autochthonous cancer is 100% resistant to the drugs that are 100% effective against the so-called transplanted cancer.
Despite its claims to the contrary, cancerology is a non-science.
When the organism is incapable of resistance, as in cancer, it is being destroyed at a rhythm and in a manner determined by its own properties.
Disease is a personal event.
It consists of the individual himself.
This statement by Alexis Carrel adds a further individualistic note to the  trans-scientific' nature of cancer.
Note that Carrel talks of the organism's destruction, but the manner and the rhythm are determined by the organism's own properties.
Cancerology thus faces a two-fold uniqueness - of the individual whose biological trajectory is predetermined and unpredictable, and that of the cancer.
Towards studying the causation of cancer, cancerology has never been able to  cause' a cancer when the cells or the animals had decided otherwise.
Whenever it has claimed to  cause' a cancer, the fallacy has been of post hoc, ergo propter hoc.
Given all these crippling limitations, it is easy to understand why cancerology has not been and will not be able to do anything against cancer, except studying it as a bio phenomenon.
Cancerology has no cancer-therapy-model bearing relevance to the human or animal situation.
Cancer, in many of its facets, is comprehensible, and its behaviour is predictable at a herd level.
Science, etymologically means knowing, not doing.
Cancer is not trans-science if we aim at understanding it.
The knowledge that cancer is essentially non-diagnosable and non-treatable can, as a concept, propel us towards not doing in cancer.
Munsif, an eminent Bombay surgeon, was fond of aphorizing that, a good surgeon is one who knows when not to operate.
What medical man needs to learn, in today's technicalized scene, is when not to act.
This movement towards inaction in medicine is gaining momentum
Lord Platt's autobiography Private and Controversial abounds in  how to avoid' modern medicine.
Barbara Culliton has recently reported, in Science, on the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project conducted jointly by the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society, employing mammography, biopsy and surgery.
To buttress the above, Culliton alludes to a study on prostatic cancer, showing that many a prostatic cancer does not bother its carrier.
A paragraph from the author's book on cancer, published in 1973, deserves repetition here.
Christiaan Barnard talks of the EKG's (ECG)  electrical squiggle' transforming happy individuals with a purpose in life, into frightened, unhappy creatures of despair.
Harrison remarks that physicians suffer from EKGitis, and Heaven help their patients.
Kraus rightly said that  Diagnosis is one of the commonest diseases.
We have by now been able to evolve an understanding that if the cancer does not dis-ease, nothing, not even diagnostics need be done, thus saving on all the investigations that otherwise necessarily follow.
Having made a diagnosis, treatment is not a must.
If the cancer dis-eases, the minimal need be done.
Today, mere lumpectomy is followed by results as good as those obtained in breast cancer after radical surgery.
Such minimal therapy is applicable to other cancers - prostate, stomach, pancreas and so on.
Cancerologists are not exempt from treating  people as things,' to earn more money.
Over years, cancer operations were done more for personal gain than for the patient's benefit; things are not altogether different now.
Doing nothing - neither diagnosing nor treating unless compelled by a cancerous patient's dis-ease - is the highest form of non-empiricism, non-arbitrarism, a kind of me-respect-you- (the patient)-and-Nature creed.
The amount of  unnecessary surgery' today vindicates Shaw's attack on the  pecuniary' interests of the surgeons.
Cancer research as yet has meant, to use Arley's words that more people live on cancer than die of cancer.
I believe, however, that one might justly summarize American medicine as being based on the maxim that what can cure a disease condition in a mouse or a dog can, with the right expenditure of money, effort and intelligence, be applied to human medicine.
What Burnet says about the USA, can be extrapolated to any other country.
The Cancer Research Institute in Bombay, founded in 1952, is a grant-in-aid-institution, under the Atomic Energy Establishment, Government of India.
The five- storey building has most things that a cancer institute would have.
In a multi-coloured handout, meant for lay consumption, it gives all adulatory details including information on the Philips EM 300 electron microscope providing a magnification of up to 200,000 times for the study of normal, precancerous and cancerous tissues.
Science is supposed to be the human search for truth.
The budget is the only part of the application which seems to have any substance whatsoever.
The above comment by a member of the National Institute of Health (USA) study section, on an application for funds, exemplifies what Hixson' found out about cancerology - when ignorant of what to do, ask for more funds.
It is refusing to interfere backing the refusal by a well-deserved assurance or discreet resignation.
Faculty are immersed in administering the grants acquired, and their prevailing literary exercise is the writing of grant proposals.
In short, the academic life has become one not of reflection, but of action.
In science today, a man gets known by the finds he begets.
The annual outlay, in the USA, for cancer research will soon reach the 1 billion dollars mark, and will have to be increased at the rate of at least 100 million dollars a year just to keep pace with inflation.
Cancer has pizzazz, luncheons, theatre parties fund-raising luaus, glamour, and  in actual dollars and prestige,' even heart/mental disease cannot hold a candle to it.
They need not worry; cancer will not let them down; Public understanding of cancer may.
There is the world of cancerology the all too common human failing of keeping up with the Joneses.
A linear accelerator acquired by one institution is soon put to shame by a bigger accelerator at another.
Berman describes how, when something happens to a bigwig, institutes jump in to make capital out of it.
The President of India, Sanjiva Reddy, was discovered to have a lung tumour.
Agreed that there is never nothing to be done, but this "never nothing" should be, whenever warranted, a Jeffersonian "pious" fraud.
With the usual fanfare he was flown to the Mecca of cancer research - the Sloan-Kettering Institute, New York.
Somehow, the Government of India was made to understand that this had to be done, because India didn't have a linear accelerator.
Someone protested, but his voice was drowned in the din of the Establishment.
The President's illness is expected to leave the legacy of the prestigious linear accelerator to the major cancer centres in India.
The USA spent 15 billion dollars directly or indirectly on cancer for the year 1968.
In 1994 the total bill for health care is expected to exceed billion dollars a day.
Surely, a sizeable part of this must be for the diagnosis, re-diagnosis, treatment and retreatment of cancer.
Many an Indian, capable of leading a useful life for himself and his society, goes begging for treatment - be it for tuberculosis, leprosy, chronic poliomyelitis - for want of funds, while cancer research and treatment, with all its sophistries, go on at the major centres in Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and Madras, where they toe the line drawn by the affluent West.
The Indian Cancer Society itself, in its birth, was  inspired by the monumental service rendered by the American Cancer Society.
No wonder we are out shopping for linear accelerators.
It cannot be overemphasized that a doctor is an adviser first and foremost, a doer only when the situation dictates.
There prevails in specialized institutes an air of  we-know- everything-about-the-disease.
Our concern here is with the latter point.
With cancer, the most feared name among diseases, it is natural that people seek the speciality centres.
Over the year we have witnessed commendable and voluminous therapeutic work on cancer done by non-specialized  general' hospitals.
The specialized cancer centre in Bombay, the Tata Memorial Hospital does less work on brain cancers than the  general' hospital (to which the authors are attached) with a neuro-surgery department that has become a referring centre for brain cancer cases, even those from outside Bombay.
The diagnostic, histopathologic, and autopsic studies on cancer in general hospital are also significant.
What is most important; however, is the fact that a cancer case treated in a general hospital, fares no worse that when treated at a specialized centre - a truth that allows global verification.
A cancer therapist's chief function is to see a lump, to excise it by surgery and/or reduce its bulk by X-rays, drugs, or hormones.
The diagnosis of  cancer', i.e. the detection of the cancerous lump/s is on the basis of clinical examination and investigations which are not outside the functioning potential of a general hospital.
Surgery forms the mainstay of cancer therapy and can be competently performed in most well-equipped general hospitals.
Should a patient ask him whether the former could be a Ulysses in the world of medical investigations, get killed by chemotherapy, or fall off the Golden Gate Bridge, the doctor's advice should be an assertive "No", for which the patient should neither deny him his fees nor drag him to the court of law.
What a cancer patient wants is the necessary  diagnosis' and  therapy' without loss of time.
Despecializing cancer would help achieve this.
Tell the people the truth that it is not important who treats and where, but who and what is treated.
Accepting Cancer The contemplation of things as they are, without substitution of imposture, without error or confusion, is in itself a nobler thing than a whole harvest of inventions.
Francis Bacon's invocation is pertinent, both for the cancer doctor and the cancer patient.
The very term contemplation carries with it the message of the need for humility, patience, and restraint.
To understand cancer is to accept cancer, with grace.
Just as  diagnosis' is imperative, for a person who merits it,  treatment' is necessary for a patient diseased by cancer.
Jory Graham is quite right in that cancer is more curable than many other diseases.
But the cure that Graham refers to has to be understood before it is advertised.
The realization that the path of Mary (one of contemplation and inaction) is preferable to that of Martha even in cancerology, can mean a lot of saving on the psychic/somatic human cost, on animals and as a payoff from these on the hard cash spent on the overall problem of cancer.
In 32 years' experience in the USA, Canada, and Great Britain, I have never seen a patient with internal cancer or breast cancer cured in the sense the ordinary man understand the term cure - i.e. to take a disease process away and never have it come back.
And this ability to be cared for includes palliation on the one hand, and life-respecting measures on the other.
The venerated cancer text, titled Cancer Medicine reveals its true and glorious purpose when it tells at one place that  symptomatic treatment' of cancer constitutes the  best clinical management' and forms  the backbone of any specific cancer therapy.
It is a sign of coming change, however begrudged, that mutilate cancer therapy is getting replaced by conservative, organ/limb-saving procedures.
The recent Hospice Movement in the West reflects the spreading acceptance of the fact that even a patient with terminal cancer needs, above everything, the dignity of being, both physical and mental.
The oceanic mass of  facts' on cancer - the outcome of the devoted work of many scientists the world over for so many years - may appear forbiddingly large to permit a useful, practicable synthesis.
The concepts and the facts presented in this book speak otherwise - it is possible to integrate the results of clinical and experimental research into a perspectival view appealing and comprehensible to the researchers, doctors, lay people, and above all, the cancer patients.
Cancer cannot be caused, cannot be prevented.
Remember that cancer has been with mankind since ages and its occurrence is neither a freak of nor a punishment from Nature.
Every cancer is a part of your own self.
The EKF (ECG) machine, a cardiologist commented, has done more harm than the atom bomb.
If you must not love it, you need not hate it either.
Each cancer, before it bothers you, or your doctor, has been with you for a long time.
Early diagnosis/treatment for a cancer is a myth to be buried.
For the reasons cited above, it is not at all necessary for you to get yourself screened for cancer.
Bother yourself about cancer when, and only when, it really bothers you.
Cancer does not always kill, nor does it always connote a short post-diagnosis or post-treatment life.
Decide to live with your cancer until it chooses to die with you.
Appreciate that cancer need not necessarily disrupt either your profession or your joie de vivre.
Since there is nothing like a cure for cancer, insist on being treated symptom-far and no further.
Any form of therapeutic radicalism is despicable overkill by medicine.
The harm is in terms of the cardiac neurosis that the machine breeds.
Must you be treated, seek surgery; should you be irradiated or given chemotherapy, insist on the minimal and be prepared for the cellular levy from head to foot that your body must pay.
You owe a duty to your body and soul in the form of a dignified death.
Do not deny yourself the dignity of dying.
Cancer is a species, class, or ordinal character.
You can neither inherit it, nor pass it on to your progeny.
An attempt has been made to go beyond the mere dictionary meaning so as to provide a wider perspective.
Related words are mentioned in parenthesis at the end of the explanation.
This is an association based on the Hippocratic motto primum non nocere, meaning that the least that a therapy should do to a patient, is to do no harm.
A substance, that on introduction into the body, excites a highly specific response in the form of antibody (a protein) and/or cells (lymphocytes).
An antigen's specific reactivity with antibody/cells allows laboratory detection of its presence in blood or tissue.
CEA, found most commonly with cancer of the gastrointestinal tract, is detected in the laboratory by demonstrating its reactivity with a specific antibody.
It is also called Burkitt's lymphoma.
The warning is undesirable for it precipitates a sort of posthumous existence with perpetual expectation of the worst, for the patient or even the physician- patient.
It is the faculty of a normal cell to cancerate and thus turns into a cancer cell.
It refers to a substance supposedly producing cancer.
A substance that assists a cancerogen is called cocancerogen, and one that opposes its action is called anticancerogen.
It means any illness characterized by long duration, or frequent recurrence over a long time, and often by slowly progressing severity; opposite of acute.
it is a type of slowly growing leukaemia characterized by the excessive proliferation of lymphocytes all over.
It is a disease mainly of the middle and old age.
Chronic myeloid leukaemia, often abbreviated as CML, is a type of slowly progressing leukaemia, characterized by the excessive proliferation of granular white blood cells, starting in the bone marrow and then appearing in the blood and elsewhere.
It is a chronic disease characterized by progressive destruction and hardening of the liver.
The fibrous protein that provides the scaffold for the animal body is one of the principal skeletal substance binding cells and tissues together.
There are small, painful ulcers accompanying inflammation of the mouth.
This is an examination of the vagina and cervix with an instrument called colposcope that provides illumination and magnification.
This is the process whereby a cell changes its character to turn into another type of cell.
The process of cell division and proliferation, the science of which is called cytokinetics.
What is commonly known as diabetes is medically termed as diabetes mellitus (sweet diabetes) because of the patient passing sugar in the urine.
Such diabetes is to be distinguished from diabetes insipidus, wherein the patient passes large quantities of insipid' urine.
The term is derived from old French desaise (des - absence of, and aise - ease), and really means dis-ease or lack of ease.
The etymologic emphasis has been lost in medical science so that the word disease is freely used even though the so-called disease - a cancerous mass in the prostate or the breast - in no way dis-eases the owner.
In current fashion, it implies cellular abnormalities of the lining epithelium of the cervix of the uterus that a pathologist recognizes as abnormal, yet not to a degree he is willing to call cancer.
A hormone is normally secreted by its special gland.
When it is also secreted elsewhere by another tissue, it is called ectopic hormone.
Thickening and hardening of arteries is a common accompaniment of aging.
This is a term to describe the inordinate faith of the doctor or the patient in the diagnostic and prognostic usefulness of the electrocardiogram (ECG), sometimes abbreviated as EKG Follow-up.
It is the medical practice of periodically reassessing and recording the condition of a patient following diagnosis and/or treatment.
It shows a theoretical frequency distribution that is bell shaped, symmetrical and of infinite extent.
Many a biologic feature, related to health or disease, exhibits Gaussian distribution.
It is the science of aging, and of the problems of the aged.
It is a mode of describing the severity of a cancer by grading it as Grade 1 through
The severity of a cancer is assumed to be directly proportional to the departure of its cells from normality when seen through a microscope.
A cancer belongs to Grade 1 when most of its cells are near-normal in appearance and arrangement, and to Grade 4 when most cells look abnormal in appearance and arrangement.
It is related to the study of tissue - normal or cancerous - with a microscope.
In cancerology, it is used as a synonym for cancer: hence, malignant tumour or malignant lesion.
It arises from an individual's own tissues; not transplanted.
In medicine in general, malignant implies grave severity of a disease: thus, malignant fever, malignant hypertension, and malignant malaria.
A skin cancer arising from its pigmented cells; can also arise from the eye, mucous membrane, and other tissues.
It neither refers to the spread or transfer of disease (cancer, infection) from its site of origin to another site nor directly connected with it.
Neoplasm, literally meaning newly formed tissue, connotes cancer, although such process also occurs in inflammation, wound healing, etc.
The occurrence of cancer in an individual is governed by many unidentifiable genes (hence called polygenic/multi-factorial inheritance) which in coordination with the genes of the entire herd, determine whether or not cancer would occur.
And such genetic governance in an individual is quantitative and not qualitative.
All humans can develop cancer; only some do, for in them the quantitative gene effect is sufficient enough to carry them beyond a certain genetic threshold.
Polygenic inheritance has been invoked to explain the occurrence of a wide variety of diseases ranging from congenital malformations like cleft plata to common diseases like peptic ulcer, heart attack, diabetes, or hypertension.
In cancerology, it refers to the site where the cancer first originates; hence, primary site, primary cancer, primary growth, and so on.
When a cancer, taking off from the primary site, establishes itself at other additional site/s physically discontinuous from the primary, it is said to have formed secondary or metastatic cancer.
It means, not threatening health or life; opposite of malignant; non-cancerous.
From the secondary site, the whole process of metastasis can be repeated.
Epistemologically, it implies a state of knowledge that is less than certainly but greater than ignorance.
Epidemiologically, it means certainty at the herd level, which, being numerically smaller than the number forming the herd, must of necessity is a matter of chance, likelihood or probability when expressed at an individual level.
Such measurement or quantisation of uncertainty is called probability.
The epidemiologic concept of probability can be best amplified by acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a form of blood cancer.
Globally, it occurs at the rate of 2 to 3 cases per a population of 100,000 per year with little variation from country to country.
It is usually applied to surgery, but also to other modes of therapy and to therapeutic combinations.
Supraradical therapy represents the extreme of therapeutic radicalism.
Radiotherapy is the treatment of cancer (or any other disease) by X-rays.
It is a type of bacterium with a new combination of DNA assembled in the laboratory through the recently developed techniques of genetic engineering.
A benign tumour/lump have microscopic features resembling a normal tissue.
When a normal cell cancerates to join the already existing cancer, it is called recruitment or neocanceration.
It is a temporary abatement of the symptoms of a disease.
It refers to cancer arising in the connective tissue - especially bone, cartilage, muscle, and fascia.
Sarcoma differs from carcinoma in that the latter arising from the cells lining the skin and internal organs, or the cells forming glands such as the liver, thyroid, pituitary, etc.
It refers to the cheesy, sebaceous matter that collects between the glands, penis and foreskin in a male, or around the clitoris, labia and minora in a female.
They are cells from a cancer that arose once upon a time in an animal are cultured over the years, by being serially bred in test tubes and animals.
Such cells when inoculated in specially prepared animals form masses that are called transplanted cancer.
Such cancers' constitute tumour systems against which drugs are tested.
It is the study of breast by obtaining its image by a technique similar to that operating in a XEROX machine.
It , therefore,  appears as improper to extirpate these as it does to suffer them to remain, when they begin to be disturbed and can be wholly removed.
A bronchus is a subdivision of the air-passages beyond the trachea (windpipe).
The patient with the longest survival of thirteen years was an Eurasian, who, all along his illness' declined treatment.
After thirteen years with his cancer, he died at the age of seventy-eight of a heart attack.
The chronic leukaemia offer frequent examples of cases living for long, when left untreated or treated only when dis-eased.
Many of the older patients may die with rather than from the disease.
She was in good health all along, despite extensive infiltration' of the bone marrow by leukaemia cells.
Asymptomatic, she was trapped into getting her counts treated by cancer chemotherapy for the last five years of her life; she then developed varied infections, and eventually succumbed to overwhelming recurrent pneumonia.
They randomly allocated 249 patients, with inoperable bronchial carcinoma confined to the chest, to four different groups, each treated differently.
One group received no treatment until significant' symptoms appeared.
The other three groups received treatment whether or not they had symptoms at the time of entry into the trial, and were given radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of the two.
The mean survival in the wait-and-see group was 8.4 months, whereas in the groups treated with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or their combination, it was 8.3, 8.7 and 8.8 months, respectively.
Cancer of the lung usually starts in a large bronchus, and thus is often referred to as bronchial cancer or bronchial carcinoma.
The group of patients whose anti-tumour treatment was delayed until symptoms appeared obtained as good palliation as those treated immediately.
The authors of the report felt that their results offered no evidence that immediate treatment by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy leads to prolongation of survival or to prevention of incapacitating symptoms in patients with inoperable bronchial carcinoma.
On the contrary, if one bothers to scan the literature, there are ample articles on just this subject' showing the natural course' of unoperated cholelithiasis, of untreated breast cancer, and so on for gastric/duodenal ulcer, mitral stenosis and cancers of esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, gall bladder, and pancreas.
An important cancerlogical reality is that all cancer from the time of inception, through five to fifteen years, to the time of diagnosis are discreetly hidden' and painless.
More importantly, many cancers continue to be painless even after being diagnosed at the primary of the metastatic site.
It was the same painlessness of cancer that allowed a Mayo, a Willkie, or a Dorn to continue to work peacefully up to the time the widespread and inoperable cancer was diagnosed, and death followed fairly soon after the open and close procedure.
The Lancet described oral cancer as an obstinate clinical problem, and lamented that more than half of all patients in England and Wales with intro-oral cancer, presented themselves at a late stage of the disease.
The truth is that it is in the very nature of cancer to be painless during the major part of its existence in the patient's body.
Like Nature, cancer is cruel but cancer is kind.
And cancer is painless, because it is, teleologically speaking, meant to be so.
This is a lymphoma with characteristic microscopic picture, commoner at younger age.
A patient who neglects' a cancer does so because the cancer does not, for long, dis-ease him or her.
Let us now consider the problem of a woman with a silent breast lump: If it is non-cancerous, nothing need be done.
If it is cancerous, you are too late to do anything.
A rational conclusion is that nothing, diagnostic or therapeutic, should be done for this patient.
Strange as this proposition may seem, it is fully backed by established cellular and tumoural cancerrealities.
An old man found to have a hard but silent prostatic nodule on routine checkup' need not be benevolently dragged into the consciousness of having cancer.
The diagnosis is, non-committally and correctly, a breast lump, a prostatic nodule, and the like.
It will be a great day for rational medicine when the physician acquires the right not to diagnose, and therefore not to treat, a cancer which is at peace with its owner.
Outrageous as this proposition may seem, it pleads that the patient be spared mental death prior to the cancer's turning obtrusive on the patient's senses.
It may be argued that unless the patient is warned in advance, he may be caught unawares by the disease.
The warning when expressly denied by the physician does not spare a patient sudden cancerous or cardiac illness or death.
The AACT ought to publicize the unrecognized and unsung benignancy of cancer, the unpredictability of cancer, the hazardous nature of all forms of cancer therapy, the damned-if-you-do' and the damned- if-you-don't' experience of all cancer therapists, and, above all, that even cancer permits of the patient being left alone.
After a week of the all-fruit diet, the patient can gradually adopt a well-balanced diet with a predominantly alkaline base.
The AACT may eventually manage to get financial aid from government or other agencies by showing that AACT could mean a lot of saving on the enormous monies spent directly or indirectly on cancer every year, the whole world over.
If the authenticity can be proved, the doctor's right to prognosticate is justified; if not, the physician can be requested to stop playing the prophet.
In the widely publicized court trial, the physician's prognosis was that Karen Ann Quinlan, the young American girl in a coma, would die soon if taken off the life-sustaining machines.
Her parents pleaded to the court for taking the plugs off so that Karen could die.
The state of the prognostic art leaves much to be desired.
Of the trilogy of disease, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, prognosis is the most difficult to evaluate.
The accurate prediction of things to come is often most baffling, perplexing, and problematic.
Remember that we are endowed with two eyes and two ears but with only one tongue.
All told, medical prognostication is more of an art than a science.
The authors know of a general practitioner's wife, in her forties, declared by some eminent cardiologists of Bombay to be free from any heart problem, dying suddenly of a heart attack barely fifteen days after being given a clean bill of health.
The first measure allows him to be condoned on the grounds of his benevolence; the latter measure provides a subtle defence for him, for rarely does a patient surviving longer-than-expected have the heart to find faults with his prognosticator.
There are doctors who, to show their worth and to be sure of an excuse, make bad seem worse and of the worse make a disaster.
The reasons why a cancer prognosticator feels so sure of himself, are many.
His diagnostic and therapeutic skills register advances every day.
His assessment of a cancer case is seemingly complete - clinical examination, endoscopy, an arsenal of investigations, and the findings at the operation.
Yet despite this impressive array of aids to prognosis, the prognosticator encounters unreliability, at every stage.
What he has always thought to be an early cancer has rarely been so.
Cancer cytology is highly arbitrary and therefore unreliable.
Histology does not fare any better.
Contrary to the experience of some workers, we have not found that the histology of biopsy specimens offers any useful guide to prognosis or management.
This is not an uncommon event, in big cities with big cardiac clinics, where a human being elatedly walks out of the cardiologist's consulting room, with completely normal EKG (ECG), only to collapse to death from a heart attack, barely a few yards away from the clinic.
This 1970 generalization by Ho - in whose series most cancers were undifferentiated - is similar to the 1960 generalization by Sutherland that, at present, prognostically different cancers are often morphologically indistinguishable.
The grading and staging of cancers represent, the valiant efforts by prognosticators at playing the prophet, depending on apparently objective criteria; but' a given carcinoma may be graded II one day and III next, or vice versa, depending on the functional tone of the gastrointestinal tract of the pathologist or the barometric pressure.
Writing on the grading of the adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum, Boyd comments that while statistically it is possible to establish some agreement between the grade, lymph node involvement, prognosis, and so on, this does not mean that it is of prognostic value in the individual patient.
Prognosis is cancer, like in other branches, is a judgement based on circumstantial evidence, but no judgement can be respected when the evidence is largely suspected.
However, his detecting cancer at one or more sites is no guarantee that the cancer is not additionally present elsewhere.
Despite such ignorance, an all too common pitfall is the urge to make favourable prognoses on the basis of early treatment.
It was as early as in 1936 that Nathanson and Welch reported that in their series of breast carcinoma, patients with the shortest delay of the treatment have the worst prognosis.
Not infrequently, a prognosis of doom proves wrong, and the patient survives, showing that the prognosticator had seen a disaster greater than was in stored for the patient.
From them the practitioner recognizes the wind direction; he knows nothing of wind velocity, or of weather conditions such as temperature, humidity or visibility.
The prognosticating physician is, by and large, unaware of the weather-vane-nature of statistics which come to him as definite, reliable, proved-correct-generation-after-generation figures in authoritative writings on diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, hypertension, or various cancers.
Cancer, for a long period, exercises discreet silence before dis-easing a person.
The prognosticator has nothing to guide him in an individual case - for which he can, at best, retrognosticate or be wise after the event.
Backed by an implicit faith in the truth of large numbers, the prognosticator finds it convenient to extrapolate the herd data to an individual, ignoring the fact that the extrapolation is fraught with Heisenbergian uncertainty.
In biological problems, variable factors of considerable complexity often are present, the necessary consideration of which distinguishes biometry from statistology.
Such warnings escape the eyes of the prognosticator and so he continues to prognosticate despite Heisenberg or McDonald.
Even when he employs statistical prognosis, the prognosticator probably neglects cautionary statements often appearing at the very beginning of the text.
It is true in diabetes mellitus as in other chronic diseases that the prognosis for the patient is extraordinarily individual.
Generalization with regard to prognosis may be based on averages in special groups and for special complications; nevertheless, wide variations are found in the duration of life and the presence or absence of diabetic sequelae within each group.
Brooke, writing on cancer, described prognosticating as perhaps the most important act in medicine.
And perhaps, this is true for altogether different reasons, namely to share with the patient and his near- ones the usually unacknowledged medical ignorance on cancer and to let the patient know that cancer can be as kind as it can be cruel.
The time of prognosticating is the time to talk things over with the patient.
Knowing that the duration of undiagnosable and asymptomatic cancer is pretty long, the cancers in the above two physician-patients must have remained discreetly hidden for many years before turning symptomatic; and for all the time that the cancers were left undiagnosed ( and untreated) , both the surgeons were mercifully spared the Keatsian posthumous existence.
It is the time to act as a patient's friend by providing him with the drive to dare the disease, and to live with it.
Prognosis involves exploring and exposing areas from where assurance can be had and destroying areas from where unwarranted fear stems.
Cancer patients often live in depression and it is for the prognosticating physician to pull them out into living a year - saying life that meets with the Kiplingian urge to fill every irretrievable minute with sixty seconds' worth of distance run.
Prognosticating includes protecting the patient against the tyranny of lay and medical articles rich in well-intentioned scare- mongering.
Carcinoma of the lung in a smoker, or carcinoma of the stomach in a gourmet, or carcinoma of the cervix in a woman who has loved live, is no Dostoevskian story of Crime and Punishment.
The occurrence of a lethal laryngeal cancer, in that sage from Dakshineshwar, Ramakrishna Paramahansa - whom Wilson calls a great mystic, a God-intoxicated saint - was certainly no retribution from a wrathful God.
What I do not know, is unfathomable.
What I do know, is sharable.
Herd-realism, normal distribution, Gompertz function, curves of disease-specific mortality, etc, are subtle and inexorable indicators of the fact that an individual, despite all his unprecedented, unparalleled and unrepeatable uniqueness, is herd-dependent with respect to many features.
In his chapter on the Statistical study of tumours,' Willis emphasizes that the age distribution of a sufficiently large series of cancer deaths, in a population, provides a smooth ideal curve' of normal distribution.
Physicians, who contemplate the view that cancer may not always be treated would have to bear in mind, however, the modern litigious society comprising patients prone to turn litigant against the doctors on not getting what they paid for or were ready to pay for.
This normality of distribution is a herd-function, and, at an individual level, it depends on the point of the curve one falls on so as to die of cancer at the age of eighteen, or ninety-eight.
To the present set to die of cancer at eighteen, ( as well as to his near ones), it is chaotic' that he should be so victimized' by Nature.
But if he and the others realize that his chaos' is a part of the orderly ideal' curve, the sense of persecution is likely to be minimized.
Prognostication in cancer should include retrognostication consisting in explaining to the patient that his cancer, dis-easing him now, has been with him for five to fifteen years.
Further, that the earliness or lateness of a cancer lies in the mind of the clinician, and not in the cancer.
The patient's cancer realism that he is harbouring a cellular phenomenon of which even the prognosticator is only as wise as he himself can make him an equally important participant in the fight against the disease.
In the absence of such realism, the patient suffers from a sense of singular victimization out of the frustration that medicine and medical men are not offering him his due.
Prognosticating includes admitting investigational limitation and therapeutic impotence.
Acne is perhaps the most common chronic skin disease.
It is an inflammatory condition of the sebaceous (that is, fat) glands and hair follicles usually found on the face, the neck, chest and shoulders.
As things stand today, medical, judicial, legal, and general public opinion would tend to hold unimpeachable a play- safe' man who treats every cancer case, but would not pardon a doctor refusing to treat until he absolutely must.
Approximately, eight out of ten young people between the ages of 12 and 24 suffer from some degree of acne.
It is closely related to the disturbance in the hormones experienced at puberty.
The majority of patients recover between the ages 20 and 30 years.
But it is still common in men over 30 years.
In women, it rarely lasts beyond the early thirties and is normally worse before each menstrual period.
The disease causes a great deal of embarrassment at an age when people tend to be sensitive about personal appearance.
The skin, covering the entire body, is a marvellous and intricate mechanism.
It serves three main purposes, namely protection of the inner organism, regulation of body temperature and elimination of cell waste and systematic refuse.
The skin is directly connected to and intimately bound up with the working of the whole system.
All skin diseases, including acne, are the outcome of malfunctioning of the body as a whole.
The position of such a risker' can be rendered progressively safe only by making the physicians and the public - lay, legal, judicial - swallow the insipid but helpful pill that no treatment is also a form of treatment.
Acne is characterised by the presence of comedones or blackheads, pimples, small superficial sebaceous cysts and scars.
There are over half a dozen forms of acne.
All of them are connected with the sebaceous glands or the glands connected with hair follicles.
The most common form of acne is blackheads.
The areas chiefly affected are the forehead, temples, cheeks, chin, the chest and back.
In rare cases, almost the entire body may be covered with blackheads with extensive scarring.
All forms of acne have their origin in wrong food habits, such as irregular hours of eating, improper food, excess of starch, sugar and fatty foods.
Chronic constipation is another major cause of acne.
If the bowels do not move properly, the waste matter is not eliminated as quickly as it should be and the blood stream becomes saturated with toxic matter.
The extra efforts of the skin to eliminate this excess waste result in acne and other forms of skin disease.
To help achieve this seemingly impossible aim, enlightened physicians can start an Anoci - Association of Cancer Therapists (AACT) who moto should be primum non nocere.
Yet another important cause of acne is a devitalised condition of the skin resulting from unhygienic living habits.
Other contributing factors to the disorder are excessive use of tea, coffee, alcohol and tobacco, strenuous studies and sedentary habits which lead to indigestion and general debility.
The treatment of acne by the administration of salves or ointment does not serve any purpose.
They only suppress the action of the sebaceous glands temporarily.
In nature cure, the main emphasis is on diet and certain water applications.
To begin with, the patient should resort to an all-fruit diet for about a week.
This regimen should consist of three meals a day, consisting of fresh juicy fruits, such as apples, pears, grapes, grapefruits, pineapples and peaches.
Citrus fruits, bananas, dried, stewed or tinned fruits should not be taken.
Unsweetened lemon or plain water, either hot or cold, should be drunk and nothing else.
During this period, a warm water enema should be taken daily to cleanse the bowels and all other measures adopted to eradicate constipation.
Emphasis should be on raw foods, especially fresh fruits and vegetables, sprouted seeds, raw nuts and whole grain cereals, particularly millet and brown rice.
Sun and air baths, by exposing the whole body to sun and air, are highly beneficial.
There are various ways to tackle many of the allergic disturbances.
Washing the affected area with lemon juice has also proved helpful.
Healing packs made of grated cucumbers, oatmeal cooked in milk, creamed carrots, used externally, have been found effective.
Packs should be applied and kept on for half an hour and then washed off with cold water.
A hot Epsom salt bath twice a week will be highly beneficial in all cases of acne.
This bath is prepared by adding three lbs. of Epsom salt to 60 litres of water having a temperature of about 100oF. The patient should remain in the bath from 25 to 35 minutes till he perspires freely.
After the bath, the patient should cool off gradually.
The World Health Organisation has listed alcoholism as one of the three most deadly killer diseases of the 20th century.
Alcoholism is also a very serious social problem.
It often brings poverty and a certain amount of crime and frequently results in marital unhappiness and broken homes.
Further, short periods on the all-fruit diet for three days or so may be necessary at monthly intervals till the skin's condition improves.
It also leads to numerous traffic violations and accidents.
Alcohol is not a product found in nature.
It results from decomposition and as such belongs to a family of poisons.
Ethyl alcohol, the main intoxicating ingredient in wine, beer and distilled liquor is a toxic drug which depresses the brain and nervous system.
Alcohol cannot be called a food for it enters the alimentary canal and is not changed or digested in any way.
It is quickly absorbed into the blood stream and then travels to every part of the body, adversely affecting vital organs like the brain and liver.
About 90 per cent of the alcohol is slowly oxidised in the liver and the remaining 10 per cent is eliminated by breathing and through urination.
Alcoholics have a puffy face with bloodshot eyes, hoarse voice and rapid pulse.
They are suspicious, irritable and over-emotional.
Vomiting, delirium, impaired judgement and disturbed sleep are some of the common symptoms.
Strict attention to diet is essential for recovery.
The chronic alcoholic, who would rather drink than eat, fails to get enough vitamins.
The few vitamins acquired by him are drained out of his system in the process of burning the alcohol in his body.
Vitamin deficiency can lead to delirium tremens, convulsions, neuritis, disorders of the eyes and impaired memory.
Excessive drinking often causes premature greying of hair due to vitamin deficiency.
Chronic alcoholism results in a depletion of minerals in the body, particularly magnesium, which produces symptoms like tremor of the hands, feet and tongue, convulsions, mental clouding and sweating.
Alcohol tends to be habit-forming.
The more you have, the more you want.
The more you drink, the less you eat.
Soon the body is out of gear, because it has been getting an unsuitable and inadequate type of fuel.
Excessive drinking imposes a strain on the liver.
Starchy, protein and fatty foods should be restricted.
It gradually destroys its functions and often causes cirrhosis of the liver.
It leads to disorders of the stomach and bowels.
It can cause brain damage as brain cells are often affected by it.
Alcohol also affects the heart which becomes weak and flabby.
Alcoholism results from excessive drinking.
Sometimes a person sinks comparatively rapidly into alcoholism and at other times, years may pass before a person becomes a full-fledged alcoholic.
A person generally takes to drinking as a means to enliven social life, to overcome anxiety or to induce sleep.
He becomes an alcoholic if he gets dependent on alcohol physically and psychologically.
He resorts to heavy drinking because of his inability to deal with the stress and strain of life.
The chronic alcoholic must first of all make a firm resolve to stop drinking.
Meat, sugar, strong tea or coffee, condiments, pickles, refined and processed foods should all be avoided, as also soft drinks, candies, ice cream and products made with sugar and white flour.
He should abstain from alcohol all at once for the habit cannot be got rid of in gradual stages.
The most effective way to treat alcoholism is to build the body's nutritional integrity so as to prevent the craving for stimulants like drinks.
The patient should be put on a cleansing juice fast for at least 10 days in the beginning.
During this period, he should have the juice of an orange every two hours from 8 am to 8 pm.
The juice may be diluted with warm water, if desired.
Nothing else should be taken as otherwise the value of the fast would be entirely lost.
Alternatively, vegetable juices may be taken.
Each day while fasting, bowels should be cleansed of poisonous matter thrown off by the self-cleansing process set up by the body.
This can be achieved by a warm water enema.
During the juice fast, the patient will usually feel no craving for alcohol.
Two vitamins, namely, niacin and vitamin A, have been used successfully to treat acne.
This will give good 10-days start towards breaking the drinking habit and will help remove not only the physical but also the psychological dependence.
After the initial fast on juices, the optimum diet of vital nutrients is essential.
Such a diet should consist of whole grain cereals, nuts, seeds and sprouts, fresh fruits and vegetables.
The breakfast may consist of fresh fruits and milk.
Steamed vegetables, whole wheat chapattis and butter-milk may be taken for lunch.
The dinner may comprise a good sized raw salad and sprouts.
It is advisable that in the beginning of the treatment, the patient is given a suitable substitute to relieve the craving for alcohol if and when such a craving occurs.
The best substitute drink is a glass of fresh fruit juice, sweetened with honey, if desired.
In the alternative, wholesome candy may be taken.
The patient should always have easily available juices, candy or other snacks to be taken between meals if he feels a craving for a stimulant.
Vitamin E is also vitally important for preventing scarring from acne and in removing old scars.
All refined foods such as sugar, white rice, macaroni products and white flour and meat should be avoided.
The patient should eat several small meals a day in preference to two or three large ones and avoid strong condiments such as pepper, mustard and chilli.
He should not smoke as this will only increase his desire for alcohol.
An allergic reaction may occur when there is contact between a foreign protein - an allergen - and body tissues that are sensitive to it.
The allergens may reach the tissues by direct contact with the skin or mucous membranes, or through the blood stream after absorption.
Allergic reactions may occur within a few minutes of the patient coming in contact with the allergen or they may be delayed for several hours or even several days.
Almost any part of the body can be affected by allergies.
The portion of the body which is affected is called a shock organ.
Common sites are nose and eyes, the skin, chest, intestines, and ears.
Allergic reactions are caused by a wide range of substances and conditions.
For local treatment, hot fomentation should be applied to open up the pores and squeeze out the waste matter.
These include pollen, dust, cosmetics, and animal hair; poisonous plants, serums, vaccines and drugs; physical agents such as heat, cold and sunlight; as well as a variety of foods.
The protein component of a food is considered to be the causative factor in food allergy, although foods which cause an allergic reaction may vary widely in protein content.
Also, allergic response to a food may be either immediate or delayed.
Among the numerous allergens in the food department, the more common ones are oranges, milk, eggs, wheat, fish, chocolates, cabbage, potatoes, tomatoes and strawberries.
Additives and refinements are also responsible for the rise in allergies.
The trouble is not only in the foods themselves, but in what is done to them - They are sprayed gassed, coloured, preserved for longer life and generally perverted.
The symptoms of allergy are as varied as the substances causing the reaction.
These include recurring headaches, migraine, dizziness, irritability, nervousness, depression, neuralgia, sneezing, conjunctivitis, eczema, heartburn, hay fever, indigestion, constipation, diarrhoea, gastric ulcer, asthma, overweight, high blood pressure, chest pain, heart attacks, a stuffy or runny nose, shortness of breath, swelling of the face and eyes, etc.
The same food can cause different symptoms in different people.
Many allergies are multiple and may be caused by multiple allergens.
Then rinse with cold water.
Allergy is an indication of lowered resistance and internal disharmony caused by dietetic errors and faulty style of living.
It is believed that the major cause of allergy is feeding babies such food as cereals, meat, corns, whole milk, etc before they reach the age of 10 to 12 months.
These foods cause allergic reactions as babies lack the proper enzymes needed for their digestion before that age.
Babies should be breast-fed for at least eight months as this is nature's way of providing all the required nutrients during this period.
Another important cause of allergy is today's processed foods loaded with numerous chemical additives, many of which cause powerful reactions.
An allergic condition can result from diet imbalance.
There can be breakdown in the body's ability to handle sugar due to excessive intake of refined sugar and consequent blood sugar irregularities, or mineral and vitamin imbalances due to defective dietary patterns.
Emotional and psychological stresses can also lead to allergies.
According to Dr Hans Salye, the world's premier researcher on stress, allergic symptoms are often nothing more than the body's reaction to stress.
A person can, through chronic stress, become sensitive to common foods or commonplace substances like petrol fumes.
First, the allergens must be identified.
It is advisable to try an elimination diet, excluding suspected foods for two weeks until the cause is detected.
Coughing and sneezing makes the pain worse.
Occasionally, by changing the brand or the type, you can find a food substitute that does not upset you.
For example, chocolate upsets many, so try carob, which tastes the same but, has not been found disturbing.
Another way to detect the cause of allergy is by Dr Coca's "pulse test".
Then limiting that meal to one food only, wait for half an hour after eating and take your pulse again.
A slight increase is considered normal, even up to 16 extra beats.
If your pulse does not rise above 84, you may be allergy-free.
But if your pulse rises beyond that point, and remains high an hour after the meal, you have found your food allergy.
The best way, however, to prevent or overcome allergies is to strengthen the overall physical resistance so as not to fall an easy prey to every allergen that comes along.
To start with, the patient should fast on fresh fruit juices for four or five days.
This is a difficult but not impossible task.
Repeated short juice fasts are likely to result in better tolerance to previous allergies.
After the fruit juice fast, the patient can take a mono diet of vegetables or fruits such as carrots, grapes or apples, for one week.
After that one more food is added to the mono diet.
A week later the third food is added and so on.
After four weeks, the protein foods can be introduced, one at a time.
In case an allergic reaction to a newly introduced food is noticed, it should be discontinued and a new food tried.
In this way all real allergens can be eventually eliminated from the diet.
The body requires a large alkaline reserve for its daily activity.
The problem of acid formation throughout the day from wrong foods, fatigue, mental stress and lack of sleep can be met by the competency of the alkaline reserves.
Boosting the normal body reserve of alkaline by liberal use of alkaline forming foods is essential for those suffering from allergies.
Second, once they are identified, they should be avoided.
The foods which should be excluded from the diet are tea, coffee, chocolate, cola drinks, alcohol, sugar, sweets and foods containing sugar, refined cereals, meats, fish, chicken, tobacco, milk, cheese, butter, smoked, salted and pickled foods and foods containing any chemical additives, preservatives and flavouring.
These foods cause toxic accumulations, overstimulation of the adrenal glands, and strain on the pancreatic enzyme production or disturb the blood sugar balance.
For preventive purposes, the entire C complex vitamins - known as the bioflavonoids, are recommended.
They gradually strengthen cell permeability to help immunise the body from various allergies, especially hay fever.
Often the addition of B5 or pantothenic acid brings great relief to allergy sufferers.
Multiple allergies may result from poor adrenal gland functioning.
In such cases liberal amounts of pantothenic acid helps cure them, although the recovery will take several weeks.
An adequate intake of vitamin E is also beneficial as this vitamin possesses effective anti-allergic properties, as some studies have shown.
It usually results from consumption of refined foods and is among the most common diseases affecting the human beings.
Nearly half of the blood flowing in our veins and arteries consists of red blood cells which carry oxygen to the tissues.
Third, and most important, general health and resistance should be built up to establish immunity to them.
Red cells live approximately 120 days and are being destroyed and replaced daily.
Each person should have 100 per cent of haemoglobin or about 15 grams to 100 cc of blood, and a blood count of five million red cells per millimetre.
A drop in the haemoglobin content results in anaemia.
The patient usually complaints of weakness, fatigue, lack of energy and dizziness.
Other symptoms include a haggard look, premature wrinkles, dull and tired looking eyes, poor memory, shortness of breath on slight exertion, headache, slow healing of wounds, palpitation of heart and mental depression.
The skin and mucous membranes look pale, the nails appear brittle and there may be sores at the corners of the mouth.
Slow formation of red blood cells in the bone marrow, either due to defects in the bone marrow itself or to an inadequate intake of iron, vitamins and proteins, is one of the main causes of anaemia.
Other important causes may include heavy loss of blood due to injury, bleeding piles and excessive menstruation in women.
Besides, a lack of digestive acid or hydrochloric acid needed for digestion of iron and proteins, or emotional strain, anxiety and worry which interferes with the manufacture of hydrochloric acid in the body could also lead to anaemia.
Intestinal parasites or worms are yet another cause of anaemia.
There are two methods of detecting disturbing foods.
Hookworms, pinworms, roundworms and tape-worms feed on the supply of blood as well as the vitamins.
Symptoms of intestinal worms are itching at the rectum, restlessness during night with bad dreams, diarrhoea, foul breath, dark circles under the eyes and a constant desire for food.
Garlic, fresh papaya and grated raw carrot can help vanquish some types of intestinal parasites.
Diet is of the utmost importance in the treatment of anaemia.
Refined foods like white bread, polished rice, sugar and desserts rob the body of the much-needed iron.
Iron should always be taken in its natural organic form in food, as the use of inorganic iron can prove hazardous.
It may cause destruction of protective vitamins and unsaturated fatty acids, serious liver damage, miscarriage during pregnancy and delayed or premature births.
The diet should be predominantly alkaline.
The emphasis should be on raw fruits and vegetables which are rich in iron.
Iron rich vegetables are spinach, green onion, squash, carrots, radishes, beets, celery, yams, tomatoes and potatoes (with jackets).
The first method is the trial-and-error elimination diet.
Fruits which are rich in iron are bananas, apples, dark grapes, apricots, plums, raisins and strawberries.
Bananas are particularly beneficial as they also contain, besides easily assimilable iron, folic acid and B12, both of which are extremely useful in the treatment of anaemia.
Other iron-rich foods are whole wheat, brown rice, beans, soya beans, sunflower seeds, crude blackstrap molasses, eggs and honey.
Honey is also rich in copper which helps in iron absorption.
The diet should also be adequate in proteins of high biological value such as milk, home-made cottage cheese and eggs.
Vitamin B-12 is a must for preventing or curing anaemia.
This vitamin is usually found in animal protein and especially in organic meats like kidney and liver.
A heavy met diet is often associated with a high haemoglobin and high red cell count, but it has its disadvantages.
One cause of anaemia is intestinal putrefaction, which is primarily brought on by a high meat diet.
Moreover, all meats are becoming increasingly dangerous due to widespread diseases in the animals which are slaughtered.
This automatically eliminates many hazards and foods.
There are, however, other equally good sources of vitamin B12 such as dairy products, like milk, eggs, cheese and peanuts.
Wheat germ and soya bean also contain some B12.
Vegetarians should include adequate amount of milk, milk products and eggs in their diet.
For prevention of anaemia, it is essential to take the entire B complex range which includes B-12, as well as the natural foods mentioned above.
Eating lacto-ovo products, which are complete proteins containing vitamin B-12, is good insurance against the disease.
A liberal intake of ascorbic acid is necessary to facilitate absorption of iron.
At least two helpings of citrus fruits and other ascorbic acid rich foods should be taken daily.
Mention must be made of beets which are extremely important in curing anaemia.
Beet juice contains potassium, phosphorous, calcium, sulphur, iodine, iron, copper, carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins B1, B2, niacin, B6, C and vitamin P. With its high iron content, beet juice regenerates and reactivates the red blood cells, and supplies the body with fresh oxygen.
The anaemic person should commence the dietary treatment by an exclusive fresh fruit diet for about five days.
Keep to organic, untreated, unprocessed foods as far as possible, and you will eliminate another set of hazards such as pesticides, various sprays and other poisons.
During this period, he should take three meals of fresh juicy fruits at five-hourly intervals.
This may be followed by fruit and milk diet for about 15 days.
In this regimen, the meals are exactly the same as for all-fruit diet, but with milk added to each fruit meal.
The patient may begin with two pints the first day and increase by half a pint daily up to four or five pints a day.
After the fruit and milk diet, the patient may gradually embark upon a well-balanced diet based on three basic food groups, namely seeds, nuts and grains, vegetables and fruits.
It refers to an inflammation of the vermiform appendix.
It presents itself in acute and chronic forms and affects both the sexes equally.
This disease now accounts for about half the acute, abdominal emergencies occurring between the ages of 10 and 30. It is more frequent in developed countries than in underdeveloped countries.
The appendix is a small tube located at the end of the caecum, the first part of the large intestine.
It is usually three to four inches long.
After having eliminated as many disturbing factors as possible, a self-search should be carried out to ascertain any suspicious symptoms from foods.
Its structure is made of the same tough fibrous outer covering that protects the entire alimentary canal.
There is a layer of muscular tissue under the outer covering and then a layer of lymphoid tissue.
The function of the appendix, which is performed by this lymphoid tissue, is to neutralise the irritating waste material generated in the body or the organic poisons introduced through the skin or membranes.
Appendicitis usually begins with a sudden pain in the centre of the abdomen, which gradually shifts to the lower right side.
The pain may be preceded by general discomfort in the abdomen, indigestion, diarrhoea or constipation.
The patient usually has a mild fever varying from 100 o to 102*F.
Nausea is common, and the patient may vomit once or twice.
The muscles of the right side of the abdomen become tense and rigid.
The patient gets some comfort by drawing up the right leg.
The pain increases on the right side on pressing the left side of the abdomen.
If the inflammation continues to increase, the appendix may rupture and discharge its pus into the abdominal cavity.
Further inflammation and infection comes from certain germs which are usually present in the intestinal tract.
Naturopathy, however, believes in dietetic cure of the disease.
The patient should be put to bed immediately at the first signs of severe pain, vomiting and fever.
Rest is of utmost importance in the treatment of this disease.
The patient should resort to fasting which is the only real cure for appendicitis.
Absolutely no food should be given.
Nothing except water should enter the system.
Low enemas, containing about one pint (1/2 litre) of warm water should be administered every day for the first three days to cleanse the lower bowel.
Hot compresses may be placed over the painful area several times daily.
Abdominal packs, made of a strip of wet sheet covered by a dry flannel cloth bound tightly around the abdomen, should be applied continuously until all acute symptoms subside.
When the acute symptoms subside by about the third day, the patient should be given a full enema, containing about three pints of warm water and this should be repeated daily until all inflammation and pain have subsided.
This may result in a serious state known as peritonitis.
The patient can be given fruit juices from the third day onwards.
This simple treatment, sensibly applied, will overcome an appendicitis attack.
After spending three days on fruit juices, the patient may adopt an all-fruit diet for further four or five days.
During this period, he should have three meals a day of fresh, juicy fruits.
Thereafter, he should adopt a well-balanced diet based on three basic food groups namely, seeds, nuts and grains, vegetables and fruits.
In case of chronic appendicitis, a short fast should be followed by a full milk diet for two to three weeks.
In this regimen, a glass of milk should be taken every two hours from 8 am to 8 pm on the first day, a glass every hour and a half the next day and a glass every hour the third day.
Then the quantity of milk should be gradually increased so as to take a glass every half an hour, if such a quantity can be tolerated comfortably.
After the full milk diet, the patient should gradually embark upon a well- balanced diet with emphasis on fresh fruits and green leafy vegetables.
Certain vegetable juices, especially carrot juice, in combination with the juices of beets and cucumbers, have been found valuable in the treatment of appendicitis.
The temperature rises and the patient becomes pale and clammy.
Regular use of tea made from fenugreek seeds has also proved helpful in preventing the appendix from becoming a dumping ground for excess mucous and intestinal waste.
The patient of appendicitis should adopt all measures to eradicate constipation, if it is habitual.
Much relief can be obtained by the application of hot fomentation and abdominal packs every morning and night.
Abdominal massage is also beneficial.
Once the waste matter in the caecum has moved into the colon and thence eliminated, the irritation and inflammation in the appendix will sub-side and surgical removal of the appendix will not be necessary.
The surgical operation should be resorted to only in rare cases, when the appendix has become septic.
It refers to a thickening of the walls of the arteries due to the presence of calcium or lime.
It has become a common ailment in modern times, accounting for much of the disability and high death rate among older people.
Arteriosclerosis is usually preceded by atherosclerosis, a kind of degeneration or softening of the inner lining of the blood vessel walls.
The most risky places for such degeneration are the coronary vessels of the heart and the arteries leading to the brain.
This condition may call for urgent operation.
Arteriosclerosis results in the loss of elasticity of the blood vessels, with a narrowing of the smaller arteries, which interferes with the free circulation of the blood.
These changes may gradually extend to capillaries and veins.
Arteriosclerosis is more frequent in men than women, especially in the younger age group.
It has been estimated that 40 per cent of all men over 40 years of age have a significant degree of obstruction of their coronary arteries and this can lead to a heart attack at any time.
The symptoms of arteriosclerosis vary with the arteries involved.
Signs of inadequate blood supply generally appear first in the legs.
There may be numbness and coldness in the feet and cramps and pains in the legs even after light exercise.
If the coronary arteries are involved, the patient may have sharp pains, characteristic of angina pectoris.
When arteries leading to the brain are involved, the vessel may burst, causing haemorrhage in the brain tissues.
A cerebral vascular stroke, with partial or complete paralysis of one side of the body may result, if there is blockage with a blood clot.
In the chronic state of appendicitis, the patient may suffer from recurrent pain in the right lower abdomen with constipation, loss of appetite and mild nausea.
It may also lead to loss of memory and a confused state of mind in elderly people.
If arteries leading to the kidneys are involved, the patient may suffer from high blood pressure and kidney disorders.
The most important cause of arteriosclerosis is excessive intake of white sugar, refined foods and a diet high in fat, and a diet rich in cholesterol.
Hardening of the arteries may also be caused by other diseases such as high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, rheumatism, malaria and syphilis.
Emotional stress also plays an important part, and heart attacks are more common during periods of mental and emotional disturbances, particularly in those engaged in sedentary occupations.
Heredity also plays its role and this disease runs in families.
If the causes of arteriosclerosis are known, remedial action should be taken promptly to remove them To begin with, the patient should resort to a short juice fast for five to seven days.
All available fresh, raw vegetable and fruit juices in season may be taken.
Grapefruit juice, pineapple juice, lemon juice and juices of green vegetables are especially beneficial.
A warm water enema should be used daily to cleanse the bowels during the period of fasting.
Appendicitis is caused by a toxic bowel condition.
After the juice fast, patient should follow a diet made up of the three basic food groups, namely, seeds, nuts and grains, vegetables and fruits, with emphasis on raw foods.
Plenty of raw and sprouted seeds and nuts should be used.
Cold pressed vegetable oils, particularly safflower oil, flax seed oil and olive oil should be used regularly.
Further short fasts on juices may be undertaken at intervals of three months or so, depending on the progress being made.
The patient should take several small meals instead of a few large ones.
He should avoid all hydrogenated fats and an excess of saturated fats, such as butter, cream, ghee and animal fat.
He should also avoid meat, salt and all refined and processed foods, condiments, sauces, pickles, strong tea, coffee, white sugar, white flour, and all products made with them.
Foods cooked in aluminium and copper utensils should not be taken, as toxic metals entering the body are known to be deposited on the walls of the aorta and the arteries.
Smoking, if habitual, should be given up as smoking constricts the arteries and aggravates the condition.
Recent investigations have shown that garlic and onions have a preventive effect on the development of arteriosclerosis.
When an excessive amount of poisonous waste material is accumulated in the caecum, the appendix is irritated and over-worked and becomes inflamed.
Vitamin C has also proved beneficial as it helps in the conversion of cholesterol into bile acids.
The patient should undertake plenty of outdoor exercise and eliminate all mental stress and worries.
Warm baths or carefully graduated cold baths are helpful.
Prolonged neutral immersion baths at bed time on alternate days are also beneficial.
The word 'arthritis' means 'inflammation of joints'.
It comes from two Greek words, athron meaning joints and itis meaning inflammation.
In the early stages, the whole body is usually involved and one or two joints may become completely deformed, leaving the patient handicapped and somewhat weakened.
There are two categories of joints, namely, synarthrosis or those which do not move very much and do not have a cavity, and diarthrosis or those which move freely and have a joint cavity.
The first types of joints are found in the head and spinal column.
The second type, which is most frequently affected by arthritis, is more common and is found in the shoulders, elbows, wrists, fingers, knees, ankles and toes.
It is an attempt on the part of nature to localise and 'burn-up' the toxins.
Arthritis assumes various forms, the most frequent being osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
Inflammation is the main feature of arthritis, which is a reaction of the joint tissues to some form of damage or injury.
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease which usually occurs in the older age-group.
It is more frequent in women than in men.
The disease results from structural changes in the articular cartilage in the joints, usually those which are weight-bearing such as the spine and knees.
The chief symptoms of osteoarthritis are pain and stiffness in the joints.
The pain usually increases after exercise.
Other symptoms include watery eyes, leg cramps, allergies, arteriosclerosis, impairment in the functioning of the gall-bladder and liver disturbances.
The possible causes include malnutrition, continuous physical stress, obesity, glandular insufficiency, calcium deficiency and shortage of hydrochloric acid.
Rheumatoid arthritis is a serious disease which affects not only the joints of the fingers, wrists, hips, knees and feet but also the muscles, tendons and other tissues of the body.
This condition is brought about by wrong food habits and enervation of the system.
The onset can be at any time from childhood to old age but usually appears between the age 25 and 50.
It is three times more common in women than in men.
The disease is due to an inflammatory process of the synovium or lining of the joints accompanied by swelling and eventual deformity.
Rheumatoid arthritis is often called the "cooked food disease."
It usually develops gradually over several months with persistent pain and stiffness in one or more joints.
Ultimately the whole body is affected.
Symptoms include anaemia, colitis, constipation, gall bladder disturbances, low blood pressure, deformed hands and feet.
The condition may be caused by hormonal imbalance, physical and emotional stress, infection, severe fright, shock and injury.
Hereditary factors may also be responsible for the onset of this disease.
According to the modern medical profession, there is no cure for arthritis and the patient must learn to live with it.
Most chronic arthritis patients are heavy eaters and often take food furnishing 3,500 to 4,000 calories.
Green juice extracted from any green leafy vegetable mixed with carrot, celery and red beet juice is specifically helpful for arthritis.
To start with, it will be beneficial to undergo a fast for three to four days on orange juice and water.
The alkaline action of raw juices dissolves the accumulation of deposits around the joints and in other tissues.
Fresh pineapple is also valuable as the enzyme in fresh pineapple juice, reduces swelling and inflammation in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
Repeated juice fasts are recommended at intervals of every two months.
The raw potato juice therapy is considered one of the most successful biological treatment for rheumatic and arthritic conditions.
It has been used in folk medicine for centuries.
The old method of preparing potato juice was to cut the potato into thin slices without peeling the skin and place overnight in a large glass filled with cold water.
The water should be drunk in the morning on an empty stomach.
Fresh juice can also be extracted from potatoes and drunk diluted with water 50:50, first thing in the morning.
Certain foods are harmful for arthritis patients and these must be excluded from the diet.
As they cannot utilise all the starchy elements of this intake, toxins accumulate and an excessive acid waste results in the aggravation of prevalent joint condition.
These include aerated waters of any kind, all cheese except cottage cheese, bacon, ham, sausages and preserved meats, pastries, cakes, pies, sweet buns and white bread, all salad dressings, all soups made from meat stock, rice and white flour products.
Candy, sweetness, sugar, ice cream, condiments, tea and coffee should also be avoided.
Fruits permitted in arthritis are apples, lemons, oranges, bananas, pears, the various berries, apricots, pineapples, plums and melons.
Vitamin A and D play an important role in warding off infections, thereby preventing arthritis.
Oranges, papayas, carrots, whole milk and butter, all green leafy vegetables, tomatoes and raw bananas are rich in Vitamin A.
Vitamin D is chiefly obtained from exposing the skin to sunshine.
Sunlight is an important factor in the prevention of arthritis.
Constipation should be avoided as it poisons the system and adds to the irritation and inflammation of the joints.
Light exercises such as walking is beneficial.
Maintaining a normal body weight is also an important factor in preventing arthritis.
A low calorie diet consisting of about 2,000 calories with minimum carbohydrate content is advisable.
Obesity places excess stress on weight-bearing joints and interferes with the smooth functioning of tendons, ligaments and muscles.
The body should be kept warm at all times.
Joints should not be bandaged tightly as this limits movement and interferes with the free circulation of blood.
There should be plenty of ventilation in the bedroom.
Rest is very important for those suffering from arthritis, who should not overdo their work, exercise or indulge in recreational activities.
Bronchitis refers to an inflammation of the bronchi or air passage of the lung.
It is a breathing disorder affecting the expiratory function.
In most cases, some infection also occurs in the nose and throat.
Bronchitis may be acute or chronic.
In chronic cases, the disease is of long duration.
The diet should, however, include an adequate amount of vitamins, calcium, phosphorous and iron.
It is more serious than the acute type as permanent changes may have occurred in the lungs, thereby interfering with their normal movements.
Chronic bronchitis is a condition of ageing and presumably degeneration of the respiratory tract that has been subjected to years of irritation by atmospheric pollutants, inhaled organism and, in smokers, too many years of self-inhaled irritants.
It has been more frequent in males than in females and mortality rate is also higher in males.
In most cases of bronchitis, the larynx, trachea and bronchial tubes are acutely inflamed.
The tissues are swollen due to irritation.
Large quantities of mucus are secreted and poured into the windpipe to protect the inflamed mucous membranes.
There is usually some fever, and difficulty in breathing as well as a deep, chest cough.
Other symptoms are hoarseness, pain in the chest, lack of energy and depression.
The breathing trouble continues till the inflammation subsides and mucus is removed.
In chronic cases, besides excessive production of bronchial mucus, there is infection and lung destruction.
The diet of the arthritis patient should be alkaline in nature and include fruits and vegetables for protection and proteins and carbohydrates for energy.
Acute bronchitis may very often occur as a sequel to a common cold or as a result of an attack of influenza.
The severity of the disease depends on the extent of the spread of infection which is aggravated by exposure to cold, damp and smoke.
The disease becomes chronic due to recurring attacks of acute bronchitis and wrong food habits.
The habitual use of refined foods such as white sugar, refined cereals and white flour products results in the accumulation of toxic matter in the system and this toxic waste collects in the bronchial tube.
Other causes of bronchitis are excessive smoking, living or working in a stuffy atmosphere and the use of drugs to suppress earlier diseases.
Atmospheric position and climate are important causal factors for the onset of the disease.
The greater the pollution, the higher will be the rate of chronic bronchitis.
In acute cases of bronchitis, the patient should fast on orange juice and water till the symptoms subside.
The procedure is to take the juice of an orange in a glass of warm water every two hours from 8 am to 8 pm During this period, the bowels should be cleansed daily with a warm water enema.
After the juice fast, the patient should adopt an all-fruit diet for two or three days.
It may consist of a couple of fresh raw vegetables in the form of salads and at least two cooked vegetables.
In case of chronic bronchitis, the patient may adopt an all-fruit diet for five to seven days in the beginning of the treatment.
In this regimen, he should have three meals a day of fresh juicy fruits such as apples, pears, grapes, grapefruits, oranges, pineapples, peaches and melons.
Bananas and dried or stewed or tined fruits should not be taken.
For drinks, unsweetened lemon water or cold or hot plain water may be taken.
After the all-fruit diet, the patient should follow a well-balanced diet based on the three basic good groups, namely, seeds, nuts and grains, vegetables and fruits, as outlined in Chapter 1 on Diet in Health and Disease.
The patient should avoid meats, sugar, tea, coffee, condiments, pickles, refined and processed foods, soft drinks, candies, ice cream and products made from sugar and white flour.
Certain vegetable juices have been found valuable in the treatment of bronchitis.
The combined juice of carrot and spinach is especially beneficial.
Formula proportions considered helpful in this combination are carrot 10 ounces and spinach 6 ounces to prepare 16 ounces or 1 pint of juice.
A hot Epsom salt bath every night or every other night will be highly beneficial during the acute stages of the attacks.
Cabbage, carrot, celery, cucumber, endive, lettuce, onion, radish, tomato and watercress may be used for raw salad.
The patient should remain immersed in the bath for about 20 minutes.
In case of chronic bronchitis, this bath may be taken twice a week.
Hot towels wrung out and applied over the upper chest are also helpful.
Fresh air and outdoor exercises are also essential to the treatment of bronchitis and the patient should take a long walk every day.
The word literally means a waterfall.
It refers to opacity in the lens of the eye which obscures the vision.
Blindness ensues when no light rays can enter the eye through the capacity of the lens.
The first sign of cataract is blurred vision.
The patient finds it difficult to see things in focus.
As the cataract progresses, the patient may get double vision or spots or both.
The cooked vegetables may include asparagus, beets, cauliflower, cabbage, carrots, celery, brinjal, mushroom, onions, peas, beans, spinach, squash, tomatoes and turnips.
There is gradual increase in blindness.
At first, vision in twilight may be better than in full daylight since light is admitted through the more widely-dilated pupil in the dark.
In the advance stage, objects and persons may appear merely blobs of light.
In the final stage, there is a greyish-white discoloration in the pupil.
Cataract is often found in association with other defects of the eye.
There are four factors which contribute to the loss of transparency of the lens.
As in case of most diseases, poisons in the blood stream due to dietetic errors and faulty style of living are the real cause of cataract.
The toxic matter in the blood stream spreads throughout the body to find shelter in any available weak spots.
It strikes the lens if that part has become weak through strain, excessive use of the eyes or local irritation.
The condition becomes worse with the passage of time and then a cataract starts developing.
In severe cases, it will be advisable to put the patient on a vegetable juice therapy for about a week.
Some specialists believe that the most important cause of many cataracts is poor nutrition.
This may be true even in the case of the type of cataract commonly called senile or ageing cataract.
The cause may be a lifetime of malnutrition.
Dr Morgan Raifod, ophthalmologist who has studied cataracts for many years, considers faulty nutrition to be a basic factor in cataract.
He has found by experience that prevention of cataract is initiated by improving nutrition.
Cataract is the most stubborn condition to deal with.
If it has become deep-seated, nothing short of a surgical operation will help in overcoming the trouble.
If, however, the cataract is in the early stages, there are good chances of getting over the ailment by natural means.
Even advanced cases can be prevented from becoming worse.
A thorough course of cleansing the system of the toxic matter is essential.
A warm water enema may be taken during this period.
However, the time needed for such treatment may extend from six months to three years.
Adelle Davis, one of America's best-known nutritionists, has pointed out that animals develop cataracts if deprived of pantothenic acid and amino acid, tryptophan and vitamin B6 needed for tryptophan assimilation.
She states that the diet of the cataract patient should be high in B2, B6, as well as whole B complex, pantothenic acid, vitamin C, D, E and other nutrients.
Along with the dietary treatment, the patient should adopt various methods of relaxing and strengthening the eyes.
These include moving the eyes gently up and down, from side to side and in a circle, clock-wise and anti-clockwise; rotating the neck in circles and semi-circles and briskly moving the shoulders clock-wise and anti-clockwise.
Palming is highly beneficial in removing strain and relaxing the eyes and its surrounding tissues.
Cover the eyes with the palms, right palm over the right eye and the left over the left eye.
Do not press on the eyes themselves.
Then allow your elbow to drop to your knees, which should be fairly close together.
Try to imagine blackness, which grows blacker and blacker.
After this initial fast, a diet of a very restricted nature should be followed for two weeks.
Fresh air and gentle outdoor exercise, such as walking, are other essentials to the treatment.
The common cold, also known as acute coryza, is an inflammation of the upper respiratory tract caused by infection with virus.
It occurs more often than all other diseases.
A person suffers from this disease three times in a year on an average.
A cold usually lasts from three to ten days.
The patient feels miserable for the first three days or so.
The first signs of a cold are a feeling of soreness of the throat and congestion of the nasal passage.
Although the disease normally begins in the nose and throat, it affects all parts of the body.
Its usual symptoms are a running nose, sneezing, a rise in temperature, headache, sore throat, chill, aches and pains in the body and loss of appetite.
The skin around the nostrils may become sore.
In this regimen, breakfast may consist of oranges or grapes or any other juicy fruit in season.
The common cold results from exposure to the virus.
Its intensity will, however, depend upon the state of health of the person and environmental factors.
Lowered vitality, allergic disorders of the nose and throat, chilling of the body, lack of sleep, depression, fatigue and factors such as sudden changes in temperature, dust and other irritating inhalations are important cases contributing to the development of a cold.
The real cause of a cold, however, is the toxic condition of the body brought about by wrong food habits such as an excessive intake of starch, carbohydrates, proteins, and other acid-forming foods.
A cold is, therefore, nature's simplest way of expelling toxic waste from the human system.
The duration of the cold will depend on the amount of poisons accumulated in the body and the rapidity with which they are expelled.
To treat a cold by means of customary suppressive drugs like aspirin, codeine, etc will only pave the way for future trouble of a more serious nature for, such a treatment puts a sudden stop to the eliminative process then taking place and forces the toxic matter back into the tissues again.
Moreover, drugs have no effect on the duration of the cold.
It has been aptly said that a cold can be cured in a week by taking medicines; otherwise it will subside in seven days.
The only real treatment for colds is a proper diet.
Evening meals may consist of vegetables such as spinach, cabbage, cauliflower, carrot or turnips steamed in their own juices, and a few nuts or some fruits, such as apple, pears and grapes.
The best way to begin the treatment is to put the patient on a fast for two days.
Nothing should be taken during this period except warm water mixed with lemon juice and honey or fruit juice and hot water.
A liquid diet of fruit juice in large amounts is necessary to neutralise the acid condition of the blood and hot drinks are needed to help clear kidneys.
Pineapple juice in particular is highly beneficial.
A warm water enema should be used daily to cleanse the bowels during this period.
The short juice fast may be followed by an exclusive fresh fruit diet for three days.
In this regimen, the patient should have three meals a day of fresh, juicy fruits such as apples, pears, grapes, grapefruits, oranges, pineapples, peaches, melons or any other juicy fruit in season.
Bananas, dried or stewed or tinned fruits, should not be taken.
No other foodstuff should be added to the diet as otherwise the whole value of the treatment will be lost.
After the exclusive fruit diet, the patient may gradually embark upon a well-balanced diet of three basic food groups, namely seeds, nuts and grains, vegetables and fruits.
No bread or any other article of food should be added to this list.
It is advisable to avoid, meat, fish, eggs, cheese and starchy foods for a few days.
The patient should strengthen the system as a whole by taking a diet which should supply all the vitamins and minerals the body needs.
Vitamin C, however, heads the list of these nutrients.
It protects the person from infection and acts as a harmless antibiotic.
It is found in citrus fruits, green leafy vegetables, sprouted Bengal gram and green gram.
According to Dr Linus Pauling, a noble prize-winning scientist, the regular use of this vitamin in the optimum daily amount will prevent the common cold and if a cold has already appeared, large doses of this vitamin will relieve the symptoms and shorten its duration.
He estimates that one to two grams or 1000 mg. to 2000 mg. per day is approximately the optimum amount of this vitamin.
His advice is to swallow one or two 500 mg. tablets of vitamin C at the appearance of first sign of the cold and continue the treatment by taking an additional tablet every hour.
Garlic oil combined with onion juice, diluted with water and drunk several times a day, has been found, in several studies to be extremely effective in the treatment of common cold.
Steam inhalation will help relieve the congestion of the nasal tissues.
The short fast followed by a restricted diet should be repeated after three months of the commencement of the treatment and again three months later, if necessary.
Gargling with hot water mixed with salt is beneficial for a sore throat.
Cold chest packs should be applied two or three times a day as they will relieve congestion of lungs and help in eliminating the accumulated mucus.
Other useful measures in the treatment of common cold are a mild sunbath, fresh air and deep breathing, brisk walks, sound sleep, adjustment of one's clothes and habits to the requirements of the season, so as to nullify the effect of weather fluctuations.
In severe cases, ulceration leads to bleeding and the patient passes bloody stools with pus and mucus.
The disease results from prolonged irritation of the delicate membrane which lines the walls of the colon.
It affects all age groups from very young children to the elderly.
Normally, it is the function of the colon to store waste material until most of the fluids have been removed to enable well-formed soft stools, consisting of non-absorbable food materials to be passed.
Persons who suffer from an irritable colon have irregular and erratic contractions which are especially noticeable on the left side.
Chronic ulcerative colitis usually begins in the lower part of the bowels and spreads upwards.
The first symptom is an increased urgency to move the bowel, followed by cramping pains in the abdomen and blood mucus in the stools.
The bowels should be cleansed daily with a warm water enema during the fast, and afterwards as necessary.
As the disease spreads upwards, the stools become watery and more frequent and are characterised by rectal straining.
All this loss of blood and fluid from the bowels results in weakness, fever, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and anaemia.
The patient may develop a bloated feeling because the gas is not absorbed or expelled normally.
Some patients suffer from constipation alternating with periods of loose bowel movements.
Still others may suffer from persistent diarrhoea for years together.
The patient is usually malnourished and may be severely underweight.
He may suffer from frequent insomnia.
Ulcerative colitis in its severe form may also lead to nutritional problems.
The improper assimilation of food due to inflammatory conditions may cause deficiency diseases.
This may gradually result in nervous irritability, exhaustion and depression.
The patient should avoid white bread, sugar, cream, refined cereals, rice, boiled potatoes, puddings, and pies, strong tea or coffee, alcoholic beverages, condiments, pickles, sauces, or other so-called aids to digestion.
In very severe cases, the patient may even develop suicidal tendencies.
The main cause of colitis is chronic constipation and the use of purgatives.
Constipation causes an accumulation of the hard faecal matter which is never properly evacuated.
The use of purgatives only increases irritation.
Often, colitis is caused by poorly-digested rough-age, especially of cereals and carbohydrates, which causes bowel irritation.
It may also result from an allergic sensitivity to certain foods, especially milk, wheat and eggs.
Often, the intake of antibiotics may upset the bacterial flora in the intestines and interfere with proper digestion.
Severe stress may also produce ulcerative colitis.
During any form of severe stress, outpouring of adrenal hormones causes such destruction of body protein that at times parts of the walls, lining the intestines, are literally eaten away.
Such stress also depletes the body of pantothenic acid.
There is increasing evidence to show that in several cases cataracts have actually been reversed by proper nutritional treatment.
Experiments on animals have shown that they can develop ulcerative colitis when they are kept on diets deficient in pantothenic acid.
Diet plays an important part in the treatment of colitis.
It is advisable to observe a juice fast for five days or so in most cases of colitis.
The juices may be diluted with a little boiled water.
Papaya juice and raw cabbage or carrot juice is especially beneficial.
Citrus juices should be avoided.
The bowels should be cleansed daily with a warm water enema.
After the juice fast, the patient should gradually adopt a diet of small, frequent meals of soft cooked or steamed vegetables, rice, dalai (coarsely broken wheat) and well-ripened fruits like banana and papaya, yogurt and home-made cottage cheese.
Sprouted seeds and grains, whole meal bread and raw vegetables may be added gradually to this diet after about 10 days.
Tender coconut water is highly beneficial as it is soothing to the soft mucosa of the colon.
All food must be eaten slowly and chewed thoroughly.
Conjunctivitis refers to an inflammation of the conjunctiva, the thin transparent membrane covering the front of the eye.
The harmful side-effects include gross liver damage, hypersensitivity, insomnia, hallucinations, a confused state, convulsions and a fall in blood pressure.
It is also known as sore eyes and is a very common form of eye trouble.
It spreads from person to person through direct contact.
Overcrowding, dirty surroundings and unhealthy living conditions can cause epidemics of this ailment.
At first, the eyes are red, dry and burning.
Later, there may be a watery secretion.
In more serious cases, there is pus formation.
During sleep, this material dries, making the lashes stick together.
Medical science believes that conjunctivitis results from bacterial infection, viruses or eye-strain.
Foods which should be excluded from the diet are white sugar, white bread and white flour products, highly seasoned foods, highly salted foods, strong tea, coffee and alcoholic beverages and foods cooked in aluminium pans.
Prolonged work under artificial light and excessive use of the eyes in one way or the other no doubt contributes towards the disease.
But its real cause can be traced to a catarrhal condition of the system resulting from general toxaemia due to dietetic errors and faulty style of living.
The patient generally suffers from colds or other ailments indicative of a general catarrhal condition.
The treatment of conjunctivitis through salves and ointments does not cure the disease.
To be effective, treatment must be constitutional.
A thorough cleansing of the system and adoption of natural laws in diet and general living alone can help eliminate conjunctivitis.
The best way to commence the treatment is to adopt an exclusive fresh fruit diet for about seven days.
The diet may consist of fresh, juicy fruits in season such as apples, oranges, pears, grapes, pineapples and grapefruits.
Bananas should, however, not be taken.
NO other foodstuff should be added to this diet.
The patient should have a bowel movement at the same time each day and spend 10 to 15 minutes in the endeavour.
Those who have a serious trouble should undertake a juice fast for three or four days.
The procedure is to take the juice of an orange, in a glass of warm water, if desired, every two hours from 8 am to 8 pm.
If orange juice is not liked, carrot juice may be substituted.
A warm water enema should be taken daily during the period of fasting.
The short juice fast may be followed by an all-fruit diet for further seven days.
Thereafter, the patient may adopt a general diet scheme as outlined in Chapter 12 on Cataract.
The eye muscle exercises for relaxing and strengthening the eyes are mentioned therein will also be beneficial in the treatment of conjunctivitis.
The patient should avoid an excessive intake of starchy and sugary foods in the form of white bread, refined cereals, potatoes, puddings, pies, pastry, sugar, jams and confectionery, which cause the general catarrhal condition as well as conjunctivitis.
He should also avoid the intake of excessive quantities of meat and other protein and fatty foods, strong tea and coffee, too much salt, condiments and sauces.
Raw juices of certain vegetables, especially carrots and spinach, have been found valuable in the treatment of conjunctivitis.
Straining at stools should be avoided.
The combined juices of these two vegetables have proved very effective.
Six ounces of spinach juice should be mixed with ten ounces of carrot juice in this combination.
Vitamin A and B2 have also been found valuable in the treatment of conjunctivitis.
The patient should take liberal quantities of natural foods rich in these two vitamins.
The valuable sources of vitamin A are whole milk, curds, butter, carrots, pumpkins, green leafy vegetables, tomatoes, mangoes and papayas.
Foods rich in vitamin B2 are green leafy vegetables, milk, almonds, citrus fruits, bananas and tomatoes.
As regards local treatment to the eyes themselves, a cold foment renders almost immediate relief by chasing away an overactive local blood supply.
Saturate it with cold water.
Squeeze out excess water and mould towelling gently over both eyes.
A daily exercise routine, including breathing exercises and fresh air will be most beneficial.
Drinking two glasses of water first thing in the morning will stimulate a normal bowel movement.
The eyes should be looked after carefully and excessive reading or close work under artificial light must be avoided.
Constipation is a common disturbance of the digestive tract.
In this condition, the bowels do not move regularly, or are not completely emptied when they move.
Constipation is the chief cause of many diseases because such a condition produces toxins which find their way into the blood stream and are carried to all parts of the body.
This results in weakening of the vital organs and lowering of the resistance of the entire system.
Appendicitis, rheumatism, arthritis, high blood pressure, cataract and cancer are only a few of the diseases in which chronic constipation is an important predisposing factor.
The number of motions required for normal health varies from person to person.
Most people have one motion a day, some have two a day, while others have one every other day.
However, for comfort and health, at least one clear bowel movement a day is essential and considered normal.
The most common symptoms of constipation are infrequency, irregularity or difficulty of elimination due to hard faecal matter.
An enema may be used if no bowel movement occurs.
Among the other symptoms are coated tongue, foul breath, loss of appetite, headache, dizziness, dark circles under the eyes, depression, nausea, pimples on the face, ulcer in the mouth, constant fullness in the abdomen, diarrhoea alternating with constipation, varicose veins, pain in the lumbar region, acidity, heart burn and insomnia.
The most important causes for chronic constipation are an unsuitable diet and a faulty style of living.
All foods in their natural state contain a good percentage of 'roughage' which is most essential in preserving natural balance of foods and also in helping peristalsis - the natural rhythmic action by means of which the food is passed down the alimentary canal.
Much of the food we eat today is deficient in natural bulk or roughage and this result in chronic constipation.
Intake of refined and rich food lacking in vitamins and minerals, insufficient intake of water, consumption of meat in large quantities, excessive use of strong tea and coffee, insufficient chewing, overeating and a wrong combination of food, irregular habits of eating and drinking may all contribute to poor bowel function.
Other causes include faulty and irregular habit of defecation, frequent use of purgatives, weakness of abdominal muscles due to sedentary habits, lack of physical activity and emotional stress and strain.
Diseases such as tumours or growths, sluggish liver, colitis, spastic condition of the intestines, hyperactivity, disease of the rectum and colon, bad teeth, uterine disease, diabetes, use of certain drugs for treating other ailments, abnormal condition of the lower spine and enlargement of the prostate gland can also cause chronic constipation.
Elderly patients may suffer from constipation due to relaxed muscle tone, inadequate dietary intake for nutritional needs and diminished activity.
The purgatives and laxatives give only temporary relief.
They unnecessarily irritate the stomach and intestines, weakening the colon.
Butter-milk enema twice a week is also soothing and helps in re-installing a healthy bacterial flora in the colon.
Laxative abuse may also lead to low blood potassium and long term chronic ill-health.
The natural way to treat constipation is to re-educate the bowels and give up all artificial aids.
The observance of regular hours for meals, elimination and sleep, a balanced diet, sufficient exercise, and a high standard of general health with good muscular tone are essential in the treatment of constipation.
The most important factor in curing constipation is a natural and simple diet.
Depression is the most common of all emotional disorders.
This may vary from a feeling of slight sadness to utter misery and dejection.
It stems from a variety of physical and psychological symptoms which together constitute a syndrome.
Depression is the most unpleasant experience a person can go through.
It is far more difficult to cope with than physical ailments.
The growing complexities of modern life and resultant crises, as well as mental stress and strain in day-to-day life usually lead to this disorder.
Complete bed rest and plenty of liquids are very important.
Suicide is the major risk in depression.
It is not always easy to diagnose depression clinically.
The most striking symptoms of depression are feelings of an acute sense of loss, an inexplicable sadness, loss of energy and loss of interest.
The patient usually feels tired and lacks interest in the world around him.
Usually, the patient wakes up depressed at 4 or 5 in the morning and is unable to go back to sleep.
Other disturbed sleep patterns are difficulty in falling asleep, nightmares and repeated waking from midnight onwards.
The patient often suffers from guilt, oppressive feelings and self-absorption.
Some persons may lose interest in eating and suffer from rapid loss of weight while others may resort to frequent eating and as a result gain in weight.
Cases of severe depression may be characterised by low body temperature, low blood pressure, hot flushes and shivering.
The external manifestations represent a cry for help from the tormented mind of the depressed persons.
The patient should eliminate all causes of tension, adjust to disability and face his discomfort with patience.
The severely depressed patient feels worthless and is finally convinced that he himself is responsible for his undoing and his present state of hopeless despair.
Depleted functioning of the adrenal glands is one of the main causes of mental depression.
Irregular diet habits cause digestive problems and lead to the assimilation of fats.
An excess of carbohydrates like cereals, white sugar, coffee, tea, chocolates and comparatively less quantities of vegetables and fruits in the diet may result in indigestion.
Due to indigestion gases are produced in the digestive tract, causing compression over the diaphragm in the region of the heart and lungs.
This in turn, reduces the supply of oxygen to the tissues which raises the carbon dioxide level, causing general depression.
The excessive and indiscriminate use of drugs also leads to faulty assimilation of vitamins and minerals of the body and ultimately causes depression.
The use of aspirin leads to deficiencies of vitamin C and antacids can cause deficiencies of calcium and vitamin B.
Diabetes, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) and weakness of the liver, resulting from the use of refined or processed foods, fried foods and an excessive intake of fats may also lead to depression.
The modern medical system treats depression with anti-depression drugs which provide temporary relief but have harmful side-effects and do not remove the causes or prevent its recurrence.
In nature cure, emphasis is placed on diet which has a profound effect on the mental health of a person.
The depressive mood can be overcome by activity.
Garlic is yet another natural remedy which fights diarrhoea and routs parasites.
Those who are depressive will forget their misery by doing something.
Exercise also plays an important role in the treatment of depression.
It not only makes the body physically and mentally fit but also provides recreation and mental relaxation.
It also gives a feeling of accomplishment and thus reduces the sense of helplessness.
The patient must also learn the art of scientific relaxation and meditation which will go a long way in curing depression.
Diabetes mellitus is a nutritional disorder, characterised by an abnormally elevated level of blood glucose and by the excretion of the excess glucose in the urine.
It results from an absolute or relative lack of insulin which leads to abnormalities in carbohydrate metabolism as well as in the metabolism of protein and fat.
Diabetes is a disease known to the medical world since time immemorial.
Its incidence is, however, much higher at present than ever in the past.
Even a single nutritional deficiency can cause depression in susceptible people.
This is especially true in case of more advanced countries of the world due to widespread affluence and more generous food supply.
The most commonly used screening tests are the determination of the fasting blood glucose level and the two-hour post-prandial, that is after a meal.
The normal fasting blood sugar content is 80 to 120 mg. per 100 ml. of blood and this can go up to a level of 180 mg. per 100 ml. of blood two hours after meals.
Anything above these norms can be termed diabetic levels.
Diabetes occurs in all age groups, from your infants to the elderly.
The greatest incidence occurs in middle or older aged persons.
It is estimated that 80 to 85 per cent of all individuals with diabetes mellitus are 45 years of age or older.
The word diabetes is derived from the Greek word meaning "to siphon; to pass through," and mellitus comes from the Latin word "honey".
Thus two characteristic symptoms, namely, copious urination and glucose in the urine give the name to the disease.
The normal volume of urine passed daily is about three pints, but in the diabetic condition it can vary from eight to forty pints.
Dr Priscilla, associate clinical professor at the University of California, prescribes nutritional therapy to build up brain chemicals, such as serotonin and norepinephrine that affect one's moods and are often lacking in depressed people.
The urine is of a pale colour, has an acidic reaction and sweetish odour.
The quantity of sugar present in it varies from two to forty grams per ounce, the total per day in many cases reaching as much as two lbs. in 30 pints of urine.
A diabetic feels hungry and thirsty most of the time, does not put on weight, though he eats every now and then, and gets tired easily, both physically and mentally.
He looks pale, may suffer from anaemia, constipation, intense itching around the genital organs, palpitations and general weakness.
He feels drowsy and has a lower sex urge than a normal person.
Not only is the overeating of sugar and refined carbohydrates harmful but also of proteins and fats, which are transformed into sugar if taken in excess and may result in diabetes.
Too much food taxes the pancreas and eventually paralyses its normal activity.
It has been estimated that the incidence of diabetes is four times higher in persons of moderate obesity and 30 times higher in persons of severe obesity.
Grief, worry and anxiety also have a deep influence on the metabolism and may cause sugar to appear in the urine.
The disease may be associated with some other grave organic disorders like cancer, tuberculosis and cerebral disease.
She recommends eating foods rich in B vitamins, such as whole grains, green vegetables, eggs and fish.
Heredity is also a major factor in the development of the disease.
It has been rightly said, "Heredity is like a cannon and obesity pulls the trigger".
Any successful method of diabetes treatment should aim at removing the actual cause of the disease and building up the entire health-level of the patient.
Diet therapy is the basis of such a treatment.
The primary dietary consideration for a diabetic patient is that he should be strict lacto-vegetarian and take a low-caloric, low-fast, alkaline diet of high quality, natural foods.
Fruits, nuts and vegetables, whole meal bread and dairy products form a good diet for the diabetic.
Cooked starchy foods should be avoided as in the process of cooking the cellulose envelops of the starch granules burst and consequently the starch is far too easily absorbed in the system.
The excess absorbed has to be got rid of by the kidneys and appears as sugar in the urine.
With raw starchy foods, however, the saliva and digestive juices in the small intestine regulate the quantities required to be changed into sugar for the body's needs.
The unused and undigested portion of raw starchy foods does not become injurious to the system, as it does not readily ferment.
The diet of persons suffering from depression should completely exclude tea, coffee, alcohol, chocolate and cola, all white flour products, sugar, food colourings, chemical additives, white rice and strong condiments.
The diabetic should not be afraid to eat fresh fruits and vegetables which contain sugar and starch.
Fresh fruits contain sugar (fructose) which does not need insulin for its metabolism and is well tolerated by diabetics.
Fats and oils should be taken sparingly, for they are apt to lower the tolerance for proteins and starches.
Emphasis should be on raw foods as they stimulate and increase insulin production.
For protein, home-made cottage cheese, various forms of soured milk and nuts are best.
The patients should avoid overeating and take four or five small meals a day rather than three large ones.
The diabetic patient should take the juice of three or four bitter gourds daily in between meals for positive results.
The patients should avoid tea, coffee and cocoa because of their adverse influence on the digestive tract.
Other foods which should be avoided are white bread, white flour products, sugar, tinned fruits, sweets, chocolates, pastries, pies, puddings, refined cereals and alcoholic drinks.
The most important nutrient in the treatment of diabetes is manganese which is vital in the production of natural insulin.
The diet should be restricted to three meals.
It is found in citrus fruits, in the outer covering of nuts, grains and in the green leaves of edible plants.
Other nutrients of special value are zinc, B-complex vitamins and poly-unsaturated fatty acids.
Diarrhoea refers to the frequent passage of loose or watery unformed stools.
The intestines normally get more than 10 litres of liquid per day which comes from the diet and from the secretions of the stomach, liver, pancreas and intestines.
In the cause of diarrhoea, water is either not absorbed or is secreted in excess by the organs of the body.
It is then sent to the colon where the water holding capacity is limited.
There are many and varied causes of diarrhoea.
The chief causes are overeating or eating of wrong foods, putrefaction in the intestine tract, fermentation caused by incomplete carbohydrate digestion, nervous irritability and excessive intake of laxatives.
Other causes include infection by parasites, germs, virus, bacteria or a poison which has entered into the body through food, water or air, allergies to certain substances or even common foods such as milk, wheat, eggs, and sea foods and emotional strain or stress in adults and fright in children.
It may also result from the use of antibiotic drugs.
Fruits can be taken in the morning for breakfast with milk and a handful of nuts and seeds.
This is due to the destruction of the beneficial bacteria in the intestines along with pathogenic bacteria at which the antibiotic treatment was aimed.
Diarrhoea may be a prominent feature of organic diseases affecting the small or large intestine such as the sprue syndrome, malignant disease and ulcerative colitis.
It may also result from operations on the gastro-intestinal tract.
Diarrhoea may alternate with constipation.
This may be a result of the irritation of the mucous membrane by impacted hard faeces.
Diarrhoea for prolonged periods can lead to certain complications.
These may include general weakening of health due to loss of vitamins A, D, E and K and other nutrients as food is rushed through the body without giving the nutrients a chance of being absorbed, dehydration due to loss of body fluids and washing out of minerals from the body, and nervous conditions.
Among the various complications, dehydration poses a serious problem, especially when diarrhoea is accompanied by vomiting.
Dehydration is characterised by hot, dry skin over the abdomen, sunken eyes, dry mouth, intense thirst and reduced flow of urine.
This can usually be prevented, if the patient suffering from diarrhoea, with or without vomiting is given plenty of liquids.
Lunch may consist of steamed vegetables, whole wheat chapattis and a glass of butter-milk.
The patient should be given about 150 to 200 ml of fluid every hour from 6 am to 10 pm.
In severe cases of diarrhoea - it is advisable to observe a complete fast for two days to give rest to the gastro-intestinal tract.
Only warm water may be taken during the period to compensate for the loss of fluids.
An enema with water temperature of 95*F, may be taken daily during this period.
Juices of fruits like orange or pomegranate, butter-milk, or coconut water may be taken after the acute symptoms are over.
Barley water mixed with an equal quantity of milk, with added sugar, can also be given.
In mild cases, well-boiled rice or khichdi (rice and mung dhal cooked with a pinch of salt), with curd and ripe bananas are permitted.
Foods which should be avoided in diarrhoea are milk and milk-drinks, whole grain breads and cereals, cheese, fruits except banana, nuts, meats, fatty soups, sweets and all vegetables except tomato juice.
After the condition improves, meals can be enlarged gradually to include raw juices like papaya juice, lemon juice and fresh pineapple juice, cooked vegetables, whole rice, soured milks such as yogurt and butter-milk.
Raw foods should be taken only after the patient completely recovers.
For dinner, green vegetable salad and all available sprouts such as alfalfa seeds, mung, cottage cheese or a glass of butter-milk would be ideal.
Certain natural remedies have been found effective in curing diarrhoea and these are carrot soup, banana, turmeric powder, the cultured or sour milk and garlic.
It checks the growth of harmful intestinal bacteria and prevents vomiting.
One pound of carrot may be cooked in five ounces of water until it is soft.
The pulp should be strained and boiled water added to make a quart.
Three-quarter table-spoon of salt may be mixed.
The soup should be given in small amounts to the patient every half an hour.
Bananas contain pectin and encourage the growth of beneficial bacteria.
Turmeric, a yellow vegetable powder used as a condiment has proved beneficial.
Acidified milk such as yogurt or butter-milk help overcome the harmful intestinal flora and re-establish the benign or friendly flora.
The acid in the soured milk also fights germs and bacteria.
It is a powerful, effective and harmless antibiotic and aids digestion.
Vomiting usually produces relief.
The patient should get as much fresh air as possible.
Other symptoms are a foul taste in the mouth, coated tongue and bad breath.
At times a sensation of strangling in the throat is experienced.
In most cases of indigestion, the patient suffers from constipation which adds to the acidity of the system.
The main causes for dyspepsia are overeating, eating wrong food combinations, eating too rapidly and neglecting proper mastication and salivation of food.
Overeating or frequent eating produces a feverish state in the system and overtaxes the digestive organs.
It produces excessive acid and causes the gastric mucous membrane to become congested.
Over-eating makes the work of the stomach, liver, kidneys and bowels harder.
When this food putrefies, its poisons are absorbed back into the blood and consequently, the whole system is poisoned.
Many persons, who gulp their food to stress and hurry, suffer from this ailment.
Dyspepsia is a word of Greek origin meaning indigestion or difficulty in digestion.
When food is swallowed in large chunks, the stomach has to work harder and more hydrochloric acid is secreted.
Eating too fast also causes one to swallow air.
These bad habits force some of the digestive fluid into the oesophagus, causing burning, a stinging sensation or a sour taste, giving an illusion of stomach acid.
Certain foods, especially if they are not properly cooked, cause dyspepsia.
Some people react unfavourably to certain foods like beans, cabbage, onions, cucumber, radishes and sea-foods.
Fried foods as well as rich and spicy foods often cause abdominal discomfort and gas or aggravate the existing condition.
Excessive smoking and intake of alcohol can also cause stomach upset.
Constipation may interfere with the normal flow through the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in gas and abdominal pain.
The habit of eating and drinking together is another cause of indigestion as taking liquids with meals dilutes the digestive juices and diminishes their potency.
Insomnia, emotions such as jealousy, fear and anger and lack of exercise are among the other causes of this ailment.
Any gastrointestinal symptom associated with taking of food is called dyspepsia.
The only effective treatment for dyspepsia is a thorough cleansing of the digestive tract and adoption of sensible dietary habits thereafter, along with change in style of living.
The best way to commence the treatment is to adopt an all-fruit diet for about five days.
In this regimen, the patient should take three meals a day of fresh juicy fruits such as apples, pears, grapes, oranges, grape-fruits, pineapples, peaches and melons.
Dried, stewed or tinned fruits, however, should not be taken.
No other foodstuff should be added to the fruit meals, otherwise the value of the treatment will be lost.
In case of severe dyspepsia, it will be advisable to fast for two or three days before adopting an all-fruit diet.
After the all-fruit diet, the patient may take a restricted diet of easily digestible foods, consisting of lightly cooked vegetables, juicy fruits and butter-milk for about ten days.
Spices and condiments such as pepper, mustard, vinegar or pickles, which make food more palatable and lead to over-eating, must be avoided.
Alcohol, tobacco, strong tea and coffee, highly seasoned meats, over- boiled milk, pulses, potato, rice, cheese, refined, processed, stale and tinned foods should all be avoided.
Curds and cottage cheese may be used freely.
It is one of the most common ailments today and results from dietetic errors.
A home remedy for chronic dyspepsia is to chew about one gram of ginger with powder of rock salt before meals.
For flatulence and gas, garlic is an excellent remedy.
It neutralises putrefactive toxins and kills unhealthy bacteria.
It also eliminates gas and helps digestion.
B vitamins are also beneficial in case of dyspepsia.
B1 or thiamine is especially useful for the digestion of starches.
But it should be ensured that the whole B complex group in some form is added to prevent imbalance which may be caused if only one B factor is given.
Water or other liquids should be taken half an hour before and one hour after a meal.
The term 'Eczema' is derived from a Greek word meaning 'to boil'.
It refers to an inflammation of the skin which results in the formation of vesicles or pustules.
The stomach, which is the most used organ of the body, resembles a pear shaped pouch.
It is the most common and most troublesome of all skin diseases.
Eczema is essentially a constitutional disease, resulting from a toxic condition of the system.
The disease covers a wide variety of forms, the majority of them, being of a chronic variety.
The skin is one of the excretory organs of the body through which large quantities of toxic matter are easily eliminated.
Because of its large surface, it can effectively eliminate waste matter which other organs of elimination - namely the kidneys, intestines and lungs - do not have the capacity to handle.
Eczema, in its acute form, is indicated by redness and swelling of the skin, the formation of minute vesicles and severe heat.
If the vesicles rupture, a raw, moist surface is formed.
From this, colourless discharge oozes, which forms skin crusts when it accumulates.
The disease is usually worse at night when the heat of the body is retained by the bed-clothes.
The skin itches at all stages.
It forms a part of the digestive tract which is a tube coiled in loops, nearly 28 feet long.
In the wet stage, it may become infected with bacteria.
Healing of the condition is affected by scratching in response to the irritation.
Scratching not only spreads infection but also lengthens the stage of drying and scaling.
Allergies play an important part in causing eczema.
Some women get eczema on their hands due to an allergy to soap or detergents used to wash clothes or dishes.
Some persons develop it around the fingers when they wear rings because of allergy to metals.
Researchers at the University of Texas Health Science Centre at San Antonio, in a recent study of children with atrophic eczema, found that 75 per cent were allergic to a number of foods.
The most common triggers for sensitive persons are eggs, peanuts, chocolate, wheat, cow's milk, chicken and potato.
The real cause of eczema is the failure of the human system to excrete the poisons from the various orifices of the body.
Waste matter is excreted from the rectum through stools, from the bladder through urine, from the lungs through breath and from the pores of the skin through sweat.
It varies in size and position depending on how much food it contains.
Sometimes the pores of the skin are over- worked as waste matter is not properly eliminated from the other orifices.
If the pores are not given the chance to perform their normal function, the sweat will be full of toxic matter and this will give rise to skin diseases like eczema, acne, boils and other eruptions.
Eczema can also be caused by stress.
The skin is recognised as the release organ for built-up tension.
Senior executives who have often to face labour problems or carry out time-bound assignments fall prey to the skin disorders known as tension or stress eczema.
It manifests itself on hands and feet and behind the neck through circular oozing lesions.
The condition can also be brought about by a nagging spouse, jealousy, frustration and a host of other emotions.
Other causes include faulty metabolism, constipation and nutritional deficiencies.
Suppressive drug treatment of former diseases is also a most potent subsidiary causative factor in many cases.
If the exudation is suppressed, some other more serious disease may develop.
An overloaded stomach prevents the diaphragm from functioning properly.
The best way to deal with eczema is to cleanse the blood stream and the body.
The treatment should start with a fast on orange juice and water from five to ten days, depending on the severity and duration of the trouble.
Juice fasting will help eliminate toxic waste from the body and lead to substantial improvement.
In some cases, the condition may worsen in the beginning of the fast due to the increased elimination of waste matter through the skin.
But as fasting continues, improvement will manifest itself.
Fruits, raw or steamed vegetables without salt, served with whole meal bread or chapattis may be taken after the juice fast.
Coconut oil may be used instead of ghee.
After a few days, curd and milk may be added to the diet.
Carrot and musk melon are particularly beneficial.
The patients may thereafter gradually embark upon a well- balanced diet of three basic food groups namely, seeds, nuts and grains, vegetables and fruits.
Abdominal pain, a feeling of over-fullness after eating, heartburn, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting and flatulence or gas are the usual symptoms of dyspepsia.
A large proportion of the diet should consist of raw foods.
Seeds and beans such as alfalfa, mung and soyabeans can be sprouted.
This diet may be supplemented with cold-pressed vegetable oils, honey and yeast.
Juice fasting may be repeated at intervals of two months or so, depending on the progress being made.
In chronic and more difficult cases of eczema, the patient should fast at least once a week till he is cured.
The patient should avoid tea, coffee, alcoholic beverages and all condiments and highly flavoured dishes.
He should also avoid sugar, white-flour products, denatured cereals like polished rice and pearled barley and tinned or bottled foods.
He should eat only pure and wholesome foods.
Raw vegetable juices, especially carrot juice in combination with spinach juice, have proved highly beneficial in the treatment of eczema.
The proportion considered helpful in this combination are carrot ten ounces and spinach six ounces to make sixteen ounces or one pint of juice.
Restrictive clothing should not be worn.
Repeat twice or thrice a day.
Nutritional measures are most vital in the treatment of fatigue.
Eczema as a result of dyspepsia, gout or diabetes can be cured only after these diseases have been successfully treated.
Children suffering from eczema due to insanitary bottle feeds can get relief if kept on fruit juices or water with a teaspoon of honey added.
Epilepsy is a very ancient disease which afflicted some of the world's greatest personalities, including Napoleon, Alexander and Julius Caesar.
The ancient people believed that evil spirits entered the body of the persons afflicted, seized upon his soul and threw his body into convulsions.
The Greeks believed that the goods induced this disease.
The early Christians blamed the Devil for these convulsions.
Epilepsy is recognised by recurrent sudden attacks at irregular intervals.
The patients twitch convulsively and fall unconscious to the ground during these attacks which cause tremendous nervous upheaval.
There are two main types of epilepsy known as petit mal and grand mal.
Two or three litres of water should be taken daily and the patient must bathe twice or thrice a day.
Each follows its own specific pattern.
In petit mal, which is a less serious form of epilepsy, an attack comes and goes within a few seconds.
The patient has a momentary loss of consciousness, with no convulsions except sometimes a slight rigidity, or there may be a slight convulsive attack such as a jerk, or movement of the eyes, head, trunk or extremities, with no perceptible loss of consciousness.
The patient may not fall.
He may suddenly stop what he is doing and then resume it when the attack is over, without even being aware of what has happened.
Petit mal attacks may occur at any time in life but are most frequent in children.
The attack in case of grand mal comes with a dramatic effect.
There are violent contractions of the arms, legs and body, accompanied by a sudden loss of consciousness.
Before the onset of an attack, some patients have a warning or aura in the form of strange sensations such as a current or air or a stream of water flowing over the body, noises, odours and flashes of light.
In a typical attack, the patient cries out, falls to the ground, loses consciousness and develops convulsions.
The skin, with the exception of the parts affected with eczema, should be vigorously rubbed with the palms of the hands before taking a bath.
With the convulsions may come foaming at the mouth, twitching of the muscles, biting of the tongue, distorted fixation of limbs, rotation of the head and derivation of the eyes.
The patient may lose control over his bladder rectal muscles.
The attack may last several minutes and is usually followed by a deep sleep.
On waking up, the patient may remember nothing of what happened to him.
People who suffer from epilepsy are not abnormal in any other way.
They usually know that fits can be triggered off by particular stimuli.
Between epileptic attacks, their brain functions normally.
Epilepsy denotes electrical malfunctioning within the brain due to damage to brain cells or some inherited abnormality.
Digestive disturbances, intestinal toxaemia and a strained nervous condition are very often the main cause of petit mal.
Grand mal usually results from hereditary influences, serious shock or injury to the brain or nervous system.
Coconut oil may be applied to the portion with eczema.
Meningitis, typhoid and other diseases, attendant with prolonged high temperature, can also lead to grand mal.
It may result from allergic reaction to certain food substances, especially some particular form of protein which is the main constituent of meat.
Circulatory disorders such as hardening of the arteries leading to the brain may also cause epileptic seizures.
This type is rare and occurs only in very aged people.
Chronic alcoholism, lead poisoning, cocaine and other such habits can also lead to this disease.
Other causes of epileptic seizure include mental conflict, deficient mineral assimilation, particularly of magnesium and calcium and wrong vitamin metabolism According to some researchers, hypoglycaemia or low blood sugar is also involved in most cases of epilepsy.
In the natural treatment, the sufferer from epilepsy has to follow a rigorous regimen consisting of a strict diet, complete relaxation and optimum exercise in the open air.
He must adhere to a simple and correct natural life.
He must assume a cheerful, optimistic attitude, refrain from mental and physical overwork and worry.
The most important aspect of the treatment is the diet.
It will help the skin to stay soft.
To begin with, the patient should be placed on an exclusive fruit diet for first few days.
During this period, he should have three meals a day of fresh juicy fruits such as oranges, apples, grapes, grape-fruits, peaches, pears, pineapples and melons.
Thereafter, he may gradually adopt a well-balanced diet of three basic food groups, namely seeds, nuts and grains; vegetables and fruits, with emphasis on sprouted seeds such as alfalfa seeds and mung beans, raw vegetables and fruits.
The diet should include a moderate amount of raw milk, preferably raw goat's milk, and milk products such as raw butter and home-made cottage cheese.
The diet should eliminate completely all animal proteins, except milk, as they not only lack in magnesium but also rob the body of its own magnesium storage as well as of vitamin B6. Both these substances are needed in large amounts by the epileptics.
Best food sources of magnesium are raw nuts, seeds, soya beans, green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale and beet tops.
The patient should avoid all refined foods, fried and greasy foods, sugar and products made with it, strong tea, coffee, alcoholic beverages , condiments and pickles.
He should avoid overeating and take frequent small meals rather than a few large ones.
If the patient has previously taken strong drugs for many years, he should not leave off entirely, all at once.
The dosage may be cut to half to begin with and then gradually reduced further until it can be left off completely.
Walking or jogging should be resorted to in order to activate the bowels.
Epileptics should strictly observe all the natural laws of good health and build and maintain the highest level of general health.
They should remain active mentally but avoid all severe mental and physical stress.
Fatigue refers to a feeling of tiredness or weariness.
It can be temporary or chronic.
Almost every person has to work overtime on certain occasions, sacrificing rest and sleep, which may cause temporary fatigue.
This condition can be remedied by adequate rest.
Chronic or continuous fatigue is, however, a serious problem which requires a comprehensive plan of treatment.
Chronic fatigue can result from a variety of factors.
A specific character trait, compulsiveness, can lead to continuous fatigue.
Many persons constantly feel that they cannot take rest until they finish everything that needs to be done at one time.
Sunbathing is also beneficial as it kills the harmful bacteria and should be resorted to early in the morning, in the first light of dawn.
These persons are usually perfectionists, tense and cannot relax unless they complete the whole job, no matter how tired they may be.
The chief cause of fatigue is lowered vitality or lack of energy due to wrong feeding habits.
Fatigue is an indication that the cells of the body are not getting sufficient live atoms in the food to furnish them with the constant flow of needed energy.
The habitual use of refined foods such as white sugar, refined cereals and white flour products as well as processed, tinned and preserved foods have a very bad effect on the system in general.
Foods 'denatured ' in this way are deprived, to a very great extent, of their invaluable vitamins and minerals.
Such foods lead to nervousness, tiredness, obesity and a host of other complaints prevalent today.
Certain physical conditions can cause fatigue.
Anaemia is a very common ailment leading to tiredness.
It is known as 'tired bold ' disturbance.
In anaemia, very little oxygen reaches the tissues with the result that energy cannot be produced normally.
A light mudpack applied over the sites of the eczema is also helpful.
This causes constant tiredness and mental depression.
Anaemia usually results from deficiencies of iron and vitamin B12.
Sometimes deficiencies of vitamin B6 and folic acid are also involved.
Insomnia or lack of sleep can be a cause of torturing fatigue.
Sleep induced by sleeping pills and other drugs does not banish fatigue.
In fact the longer sleeping pills are used, the more nagging and chronic the fatigue becomes.
Besides causing fatigue, sleeping pills lead to nervous tension which increases fatigue still more.
The harmful effects of wakefulness are indeed small compared with the effects of sleeping pills.
Insomnia can be remedied by correcting diet and developing the will to relax.
Intestinal parasites can also lead to fatigue as they rob the body of good nourishment and gorge themselves on rich red blood.
The pack should be applied for an hour at a time.
Other ailments which can cause fatigue are low blood pressure, low blood sugar, any kind of infection in the body, liver damage, a sluggish thyroid and allergy to certain foods and drugs caused by additives including artificial flavours, colours and preservatives.
Mental tension is one of the major causes of fatigue.
The person who is tense and cannot relax has all the muscles of his body more or less contracted.
This leads to needless waste of unusually large amounts of energy.
Food is continuously burnt; lactic acid accumulates more rapidly than it can be carried to the liver for conversion to body starch.
Persons who are high-strung, nervous and irritable usually suffer from this type of fatigue.
Unresolved emotional problems can also result in fatigue.
Resentment to a situation, environment and even to a person can greatly contribute to the feeling of tiredness.
It is better to express one's emotions rather than store them.
Other emotional factors like worry, a feeling of boredom and a defeatist mentality can result in fatigue.
Studies reveal that people who eat small mid meals suffer less from fatigue and nervousness, think more clearly and are more efficient than those who eat only three meals daily.
In uncooked cereals we do have one perfect food for perfect health which contains the essential vitamins and energy creators.
The patient should avoid the use of alcohol, nicotine, spices and condiments, flesh foods, chillies, sour things, pickles, strong tea and coffee.
In addition to cereal seeds, Marsh recommends fresh raw nuts taken directly from the shell and root vegetables.
He says, "Any seed or root vegetable that will grow again will renew human vitality".
Although chronic in character, it breaks in acute attacks.
It is a disease of the wealthy and chiefly affects the middle-aged men.
Women, after menopause, are also sometimes affected by this disease.
Gout was known to the physicians of ancient Greece and Rome.
It was recognised in the 18th century that large enjoyable meals and the consumption of alcoholic drinks were often the prelude to an attack of gout.
This disease affected many famous men in history, including Alexander the Great, Luther, Newton, Milton, Dr Johnson, Franklin and Louis XIV.
An attack of gout is usually accompanied by acute pain in the big toe, which becomes tender, hot and swollen in a few hours.
Usually it is almost impossible to put any weight on the affected foot in the acute stage.
It may also affect other joints such as the knees and wrists in a similar manner.
Sometimes more than one joint may be affected at a time.
Eight to ten glasses of water should be taken daily but water should not be taken with meals as it dilutes the digestive juices and delays digestion.
The attack usually occurs at mid- night or in the early hours of the morning, when the patient is suddenly awakened.
The acute attack generally lasts for a week or so.
During this period the patient may run a slight fever, and feel disinclined to eat.
His general health usually remains unaffected.
The attack may occur again after several weeks or months.
The interval becomes shorter if the disease is not treated properly.
The joint gradually becomes damaged by arthritis.
This is chronic gout, in which chalky lumps of uric acid crystals remain in the joint and also form under the skin.
Another serious complication of gout is kidney stones containing uric acid, causing severe colic pains in the stomach.
In some cases the kidneys become damaged and do not function properly.
And above all, haste should be avoided while eating and meals should be served in a pleasing and relaxed atmosphere.
This is a serious condition as the poisonous waste products which are normally removed by the kidneys accumulate in the blood.
The chief cause of gout is the formation of uric acid crystals in the joints, skin and kidneys.
Uric acid is an end product of the body's chemical processes.
Those affected by gout have a higher level of uric acid than the normal, due to either the formation of increased amounts of acid or to the reduced amounts of acid being passed out by kidneys in the urine.
This uric acid usually remains dissolved in the blood.
But when the blood becomes too full of it, the uric acid forms needle-shaped crystals in the joints which bring about attacks of gout.
Heredity is an important factor in causing this disease and certain races are prone to gout.
Other causes include excessive intake of alcoholic drinks, regular eating of foods rich in protein and carbohydrate and lack of proper exercise.
Stress is also regarded as an important cause of gout.
During the alarm reaction, millions of body cells are destroyed and large quantities of uric acid freed from these cells enter the tissues.
From the commencement of the treatment, a warm water enema should be used daily for about a week to cleanse the bowels.
The patient should undertake a fast for five to seven days on orange juice and water.
Sometimes, the condition may worsen in the early stages of fasting when uric acid, dissolved by juices, is thrown into the blood stream for elimination.
This usually clears up if fasting is continued.
In severe cases it is advisable to undertake a series of short fasts for three days or so rather than one long fast.
A warm water enema should be used daily during the period of fasting to cleanse the bowels.
After the acute symptoms of gout have subsided, the patient may adopt an all-fruit diet for further three or four days.
IN this regime, he should have three meals a day of juicy fruits such as grapes, apples, pears, peaches, oranges and pineapples.
The patient should avoid all purine and uric acid producing foods such as all meats, eggs and fish.
Glandular meats are especially harmful.
He should also avoid all intoxicating liquors, tea, coffee, sugar, white flour and their products, and all canned and processed foods.
Foods high in potassium such as potatoes, bananas, leafy green vegetables, beans and raw vegetable juices are protective against gout.
The baths may be reduced to two per week later.
A raised diastolic pressure is considered more serious than the raised systolic pressure as it has a serious long-term effect.
Cold packs at night applied to the affected joints will be beneficial.
Fresh air and outdoor exercise are also essential.
The patient should eliminate as much stress from his life as possible.
The term coronary heart disease covers a group of clinical syndromes arising particularly from failure of the coronary arteries to supply sufficient blood to the heart.
They include angina pectoris, coronary thrombosis or heart attack and sudden death without infarction.
There has been a marked increase in the incidence of heart disease in recent years.
Heart attacks have become the number one killer in western countries.
They rank third in India, after tuberculosis and infections.
The disease affects people of all ages and both sexes, although it is more common in men than in women, especially in those aged 40-60 years.
Carrot juice in combination with juices of beet and cucumber is especially beneficial.
The heart, the most vital organ in the body, is a muscle about the size of a clenched fist.
It starts working even before birth inside the womb.
Weighing about 300 grams, it pumps about 4,300 gallons of blood every day through the body and supplies oxygen and nourishment to all the organs.
It beats 100000 times a day, continually pumping the blood through more than 60,000 miles of tiny blood vessels.
The heart, in turn, needs blood for its nourishment, which is supplied by coronary arteries.
In the event of narrowing or hardening of the arteries on account of their getting plugged with fatty substances, the flow of blood is restricted.
The heart then does not get sufficient oxygen.
This condition is known as ischemia of the heart or angina pectoris, which is a Latin word meaning pain in the chest.
It is actually a cry of the heart for more blood.
In this condition, exercise or excitement provokes severe chest pain and so limits the patient's physical activity.
Three ounces each of beet and cucumber juices should be mixed in ten ounces of carrot juice to make a pint or sixteen ounces of combined juice.
It serves as a warning to slow down and prompt preventive measures will prevent a heart attack.
If the narrowed arteries get blocked due to a clot or thrombus inside them, causing death of that portion of the heart which depends upon the choked arteries, it is called a heart attack or coronary thrombosis.
It may lead to death or heal, leaving a scar.
Patients with healed lesions may be severely disabled or may be able to resume normal life with restrictions in their physical activities.
A high proportion of cases of sudden death occur in persons who have had angina pectoris or coronary thrombosis.
The coronary arteries get narrowed due to various chemical deposits on their inner linings.
These are caused by inherited or acquired defects in the metabolic processes of the body with regard to intake and absorption of various substances.
A diet rich in fatty foods, especially animal fats, causes fatty substances to settle in the coronary arteries, thus blocking and narrowing them.
The process of silting up of arteries is known as arteriosclerosis and is a major degenerative change affecting the circulatory system.
A common symptom of heart disease is shortness of breath, which is caused by the blood being deprived of the proper account of oxygen.
Raw potato juice and fresh pineapple juice are also beneficial.
Another common symptom is chest pain or pain down either arm other symptoms are palpitation, fainting, emotional instability, cold hand and feet, frequent perspiration and fatigue.
All these symptoms may be caused by many other disorders.
Appropriate tests and studies are, therefore, essential to establish the true nature of these symptoms.
The basic causes of heart disease are wrong food habits, faulty style of living and various stresses.
The famous Framingham Heart Study of the National Heart and Lung Institutes identified seven major risk factors in coronary heart disease.
Any one or a combination of these risk factors can contribute to heart disease.
Most of them are of dietary origin.
These risk factors can be controlled by changing one's life style and re-adjusting the diet.
Constant worry and tension stimulates the adrenal glands to produce more adrenaline and cartisons.
This also contributes to constricted arteries, high blood pressure and increased work for the heart.
Because of the increased risk of stones in the urinary tract, patients should maintain a good intake of non-alcoholic fluids.
The fundamental factor in all heart diseases is the diet.
A corrective diet designed to alter body chemistry and improve the quality of general nutritional intake can, in many cases, reverse the degenerative changes which have occurred in the heart and blood vessels.
The diet should be lacto-vegetarian, low in sodium and calories.
It should consist of high quality, natural organic foods, with emphasis on whole grains, seeds, fresh fruits and vegetables.
Foods which should be eliminated are all white flour products, sweets, chocolates, canned foods in syrup, soft drinks, squashes, all hard fats of animal origin such as butter, cream and fatty meats.
Salt and sugar should be reduced substantially.
Most flesh foods have high sodium content and some meats are also very fatty.
They are also highly acid-forming and create a high level of toxic matter in the system.
They should be avoided by patients with a heart disease.
The patient should also avoid tea, coffee, alcohol and tobacco.
They should drink at least eight glasses of cold or hot water daily.
Tea and coffee contain caffeine which has a toxic effect on the heart and nervous system.
Caffeine is a strong cardiac stimulant, which if taken regularly can cause palpitation or disturbances of heart rhythm.
Alcohol damages the liver and over stimulates the heart.
It also alters the blood sugar level and depletes the body's vitamin B reserve.
Nicotine has a toxic, irritant effect on the heart muscles and disturbs the blood sugar level.
The diet of the patient with heart disease should consist of nutrients as near to their whole natural state as possible so as to ensure an adequate intake of essential vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Fruits and vegetables should form a large part of the diet and should be taken in their fresh raw state whenever possible.
Grapes and apples are particularly beneficial.
The essential fatty acids which reduce serum cholesterol levels and minimise the risk of arteriosclerosis can be obtained from sunflower seed oil, corn oil or safflower oil.
Several studies have indicated that garlic can reduce the cholesterol level in persons whose body normally cannot regulate it.
The feet should be bathed in Epsom salt foot baths twice daily.
Another important cholesterol lowering herb is alfalfa.
Lecithin helps prevent fatty deposits in arteries.
Best food sources are unrefined, raw, crude vegetable oils, seeds and grains.
Patients with heart disease should increase their intake of foods rich in vitamin E, as this vitamin promotes heart functioning by improving oxygenation of the cells.
It also improves the circulation and muscle strength.
Many whole meal products and green vegetables, particularly the outer leaves of cabbage, are good sources of vitamin E.
The vitamin B group is important for heart and circulatory disorders.
The best sources of vitamin B are whole grains.
Vitamin C is also essential as it protects against spontaneous breaks in capillary walls which can lead to heart attacks.
It also guards against high blood cholesterol.
Half a pound to one pound of salt may be added to a foot bath of hot water.
The stress of anger, fear, disappointment and similar emotions can raise blood fat and cholesterol levels immediately but this reaction to stress can do little harm if the diet is adequate in vitamin C and panthothenic acid.
The richest sources of vitamin C are citrus fruits.
The patient should also pay attention to other laws of nature for health building such as taking moderate exercise, getting proper rest and sleep, adopting the right mental attitude and getting fresh air and drinking pure water.
Hypertension or high blood pressure, as it is more commonly known, is regarded as the silent killer.
It is a disease of the modern age.
The fast pace of life and the mental and physical pressures caused by the industrial and metropolitan environments give rise to psychological tensions.
Worry and mental tension increase the adrenaline in the blood stream and this, in turn, causes the pressure of the blood to rise.
The blood which circulates through the arteries within the body supplies every cell with nourishment and oxygen.
The force exerted by the heart as it pumps the blood into the large arteries creates a pressure within them and this is called blood pressure.
A certain level of blood pressure is thus essential to keep the blood circulating in the body.
Full Epsom salt baths should also be taken three times a week.
But when the pressure becomes too high, it results in hypertension which is caused by spasms or the narrowing of the small blood vessels, known as capillaries, throughout the body.
This narrowing puts more stress on the heart to pump blood through the blood vessels.
Hence, the pressure of the blood to get through rises in proportion to the pressure on the heart.
The blood pressure is measured with an instrument called sphygmomanometer in millimetres of the mercury.
The highest pressure reached during each heartbeat is called systolic pressure and the lowest between two beats is known as diastolic pressure.
The first gives the pressure of the contraction of the heart as it pushes the blood on its journey through the body and indicates the activity of the heart.
The second represents the pressure present in the artery when the heart is relaxed and shows the condition of the blood vessels.
The blood pressure level considered normal is 120/70, but may go up to 140/90 and still be normal.
Blood pressure between 140/90 and 160/95 is considered border line area.
From 160/96 to 180/144, it is classed as moderate hypertension, while 180/115 upward is considered severe.
Mild and moderate hypertension may not produce any symptoms for years.
An irregular lifestyle, smoking and an excessive intake of intoxicants, tea, coffee, cola drinks and refined foods destroy the natural pace of life.
Influenza is passed on with ease from the affected person to many others who are also in an equally low vital state.
The expulsion of waste and poisonous matter from the body is prevented and the arteries and the veins become slack.
Hardening of the arteries, obesity, diabetes and severe constipation also lead to hypertension.
Other causes of high blood pressure are excessive intake of pain-killers, table salt, food allergies and eating a high-fat, low-fibre diet and processed foods deficient in essential nutrients.
Drugs do not remove the cause, nor do they cure the condition.
All drugs against hypertension without exception are toxic and have distressing side-effects.
The safest way to cure hypertension is to eliminate the poisons from the system which cause it.
Persons with high blood pressure should always follow a well-balanced routine of proper diet, exercise and rest.
Diet is of primary importance.
Meat and eggs cause blood pressure to rise more than any other food.
The first symptom may appear in the form of pain in the back of the head and neck on waking in the morning, which soon disappears.
A natural diet consisting of fresh fruits and vegetables, instead of a traditional diet, is helpful in getting rid of the poisons from the body.
A hypertension patient should start the process of healing by living on all- fruit diet for atleast a week, and take fruits at five-hourly intervals, thrice a day.
He should take juicy fruits such as oranges, apples, pears, mangoes, guavas, pineapples and grapes.
Milk may be taken after a week of a diet of fruits only.
The milk should be fresh and boiled only once.
The patient can be permitted cereals in the diet after two weeks.
Vegetables are also good for a patient of hypertension.
They should preferably be taken raw.
If they are cooked, it could be ensured that their natural goodness is not destroyed in the process of cooking.
Vegetables like cucumber, carrot, tomato, onion, radish, cabbage and spinach are best taken in their raw form.
Some of the other usual symptoms of hypertension are dizziness, aches and pains in the arms, shoulder region, leg and back, palpitation, pain in the heart region, frequent urination, nose-bleeding, nervous tension and fatigue, crossness, emotional upsets, tiredness and wakefulness.
They may be cut into small pieces and sprinkled with a little salt and the juice of a lemon added to them so as to make them more palatable.
The intake of salt should be restricted; in any case it should not be taken more than four grams or half a teaspoon per day.
Baking powder, containing sodium carbonate should also be avoided.
Garlic is regarded as one of the most effective remedies to lower blood pressure.
The pressure and tension are reduced because it has the power to ease the spasm of the small arteries.
Garlic also slows the pulse and modifies the heart rhythm besides relieving the symptoms of dizziness, numbness, and shortness of breath and the formation of gas within the digestive tract.
The average dosage should be two to three capsules a day to make a dent in the blood pressure.
Recent studies have revealed an important link between dietary calcium and potassium and hypertension.
Researchers have found that people who take potassium-rich diets have a low incidence of hypertension even if they do not control their salt-intake.
They have also found that people with hypertension do not seem to get much calcium in the form of dairy products.
A person suffering from high blood pressure cannot do any serious work, feels tired and out of sorts all the time.
The two essential nutrients seem to help the body throw off excess sodium and are involved in important functions which control the working of the vascular system Potassium is found in abundance in fruits and vegetables and calcium in dairy products.
The patient of hypertension should follow a plan of a well-balanced diet in which the constituents of food should be approximately in the following proportion: carbohydrate twenty per cent, protein ten to fifteen per cent, fat five per cent and fruits and vegetable sixty to sixty-five percent.
In this plan, one main meal should be based on raw foods while the second main meal may consist of cooked foods.
Meals should be taken slowly and in a relaxed atmosphere.
Food should be well masticated as the process of digestion begins in the mouth.
Dinner should not normally be taken late.
Low blood sugar, or hypoglycaemia, to give it a proper medical term, is a disorder of blood sugar metabolism.
It is a condition in which the pancreas produces excessive insulin, causing the blood sugar to drop.
This may result in diabetes in later life.
Hypoglycaemia sometimes occurs in healthy people some hours after a meal rich in carbohydrates, especially following muscular exertion.
He may experience difficulty in breathing and suffer from dyspepsia.
It is frequently found in the first few days of life, especially in premature infants.
Hypoglycaemia is a serious disorder as the brain cannot function properly when the blood sugar level is too low.
Like all other organs of the body, the brain receives its fuel from the diet.
But it can use only the sugar produced by the body from the carbohydrates.
Unlike many other body tissues, it cannot store its fuel.
Therefore, it must get a constant supply of sugar through the blood stream.
Mental disturbances caused by low blood sugar levels can seriously affect a person's life and repeated attacks of hypoglycaemia may lead to permanent mental changes.
A craving for sweets and starches in excessive amounts between meals is the first sign of a low blood sugar level.
When the blood sugar level falls much below normal, symptoms such as palpitations, excessive sweating, nervousness, irritability, fatigue, depression, disturbed vision and headache appear.
Other symptoms are trembling, numbness, absent-mindedness, dizziness, and some sexual disturbances.
Hypertension, if not eliminated, may cause heart attacks or strokes and other disabilities such as detachment of the retina.
Most patients feel hungry and eat frequently to get over the feeling of weakness and emotional irritability.
They feel tense if they have to go without food for several hours.
The onset is sudden and the patient may quickly become confused and clumsy.
If the condition is not treated promptly, he may become unconscious or very sleepy.
Low blood sugar is usually caused by an excessive intake of refined foods, sugar and sugary foods as well as soft drinks, cola drinks and coffee.
These substances cause the pancreas, the adrenal glands and the liver to lose their ability to handle the sugar properly.
An attack of hypoglycaemia may be precipitated by the administration of insulin or similar drugs without adequate carbohydrate coverage during the treatment of diabetes mellitus.
Other causes of low blood sugar are tumours of the islet cells of pancreas which secrete insulin, disturbed functioning of the liver, pituitary gland or adrenal glands.
Stress intensifies this condition as it weakens the adrenal glands and starts a faulty pattern of glucose intolerance.
The high animal protein diet generally prescribed for hypoglycaemia is not suitable for this disorder.
The most important causes of hypertension are stress and a faulty style of living.
It may help control the condition temporarily, but it is harmful in many other respects.
Continuous intake of high protein diet may lead to other diseases like heart trouble, arthritis, kidney problem and cancer.
The ideal diet for hypoglycaemia should be based on three basic food groups, namely grains, seeds and nuts, vegetables and fruits, supplemented by milk, milk products and vegetable oils.
Seeds, nuts and grains should be the main constituents of this diet.
Seeds and nuts should be taken in their raw form.
Grains in the form of cereals should be cooked.
Cooked grains are digested slowly and they release the nutrients and sugar into the blood stream gradually, six to eight hours after meals.
This will keep the blood sugar level normal and constant for a long period.
Persons suffering from low blood sugar should take six to eight small meals a day instead of two or three large ones.
Eating raw nuts and seeds such as pumpkin or sunflower seeds or drinking milk, butter-milk or fruit juices between meals will be highly beneficial.
People who are usually tense suffer from high blood pressure, especially when under stress.
All refined and processed foods, white sugar, white flour and their by-products should be completely eliminated from the diet.
Coffee, alcohol and soft drinks should also be avoided.
The consumption of salt should be reduced as an excessive intake of salt causes loss of blood potassium, which causes blood sugar to drop.
Influenza, also known as flu, is the clinical condition that results from infection with influenza virus.
The main effects of the influenza virus are on the upper respiratory tract, the nose and throat, with possible spread and involvement of the lungs and bronchi.
It is highly contagious and it has a potential to cause widespread epidemics affecting a sizeable portion of a population at any time.
Although the disease is more common during the cold months, it may strike at any time.
It usually begins with chills, fever, headache and severe muscular pains.
The patient feels miserable and weak.
There is an inflammation in the nose and throat, which may spread down the windpipe to the lungs, resulting in a sore throat, cough, running of the nose and eyes.
If the stress continues for a long period, the pressure may become permanently raised and may not come down even after removal of the stress.
In milder cases of influenza, the temperature rises to 102*F and lasts for two or three days.
In severe cases, it may go up to 104*F and last for four to five days.
The weakness and fatigue that follows may continue for several weeks.
This may be followed by a deep chest cough due to irritation in the windpipe.
In children the disease may start with a convulsion and a rapid rise in temperature to 105*F to 106*F.
The patient feels extremely weak.
Influenza is what is known as germ disease.
It is, however, now caused primarily by the action of the germs and is generally believed, but develops due to a toxic and run-down condition of the system of the affected person.
This condition is brought about by dietetic errors and a faulty style of living such as worry, overwork, lack of proper exercise, living in stuffy rooms and keeping late hours.
No germs can find lodgement and become active in the system of a person who is perfectly healthy in the true sense of the term.
That is how an epidemic starts.
Bananas, or dried, stewed or tinned fruits, however, should not be taken.
A hot water enema should be taken daily during this period to ensure regular bowel elimination, thereby preventing the absorption of decomposed, poisonous material into the blood stream.
No other foodstuff should be added to the fruit meals; otherwise the value of the treatment will be lost.
This may be followed by a further two or three days on fruit and milk diet.
Thereafter, the patient may adopt a well-balanced diet of three basic food groups, namely, seeds, nuts and grains, vegetables and fruits as outlined in Chapter 1 on Diet in health and disease.
Spices and condiments, and pickles, which make food more palatable and lead to overeating, must be avoided.
Lemon juice may be used in salad dressing.
Carrot and spinach juices have been found especially beneficial in the treatment of influenza.
The juices of these two vegetables may be taken separately or in combination by mixing six ounces of spinach juice with ten ounces of carrot juice.
The vegetables should, however, be thoroughly washed with plenty of cold, running water to remove the remnants of insecticide sprays etc before juices are extracted.
During the course of the fever, the natural way of reducing temperature is by means of cold packs.
Influenza, like all other acute diseases, is a natural attempt at self-cleansing and if rightly treated in a natural way, immense good can ensue so far as the future health of the patient is concerned.
It is advisable to apply a body pack several times a day, with one to the throat in case of a sore throat.
The pack is made by wringing out a sheet or other large square piece of linen material in cold water, wrapping it right around the body and legs of the patient and then covering completely with a blanket.
In case of the throat pack, the linen may be covered with a piece of flannel.
The packs can be kept for an hour or so.
The body should be sponged with tepid water after removing the pack.
The patient should be kept in bed and should stay there till he is well again.
The term insomnia literally denotes a complete lack of sleep.
It is, however, used to indicate a relative inability to sleep that consists of difficulty in falling asleep, difficulty in staying asleep, early awakening or a combination of any of these complaints.
Insomnia deprives the person of mental rest and thereby interferes with his activities in the day time.
It constitutes a severe health hazard when it becomes a habit.
The treatment of the disease along modern medical lines may bring about many complications such as pneumonia, kidney disorders, ear and chest troubles.
Sleep is a periodic state of rest for the body which is absolutely essential for its efficient functioning.
It is the indispensable condition to the recuperation of energy.
It gives relief from tension, rests the brain and body and a person wakes up in the morning fresh and relaxed.
The amount of sleep varies within very wide limits from individual to individual.
Normally, seven to eight hours of sleep every night is adequate for most people.
Some, however, do well with four to five hours because their sleep is deeper and more refreshing.
Insomnia is common among the elderly for a variety of reasons.
The sleep of the elderly is often punctuated by brief periods of wakefulness during the night.
In such cases it is the quality rather than the quantity which is most affected.
With age, there is a gradual reduction of period of deep sleep.
This is due to the suppressive nature of the treatment which halts the cleansing process and forces toxic matter deeper into the system again.
Sleep requirements also diminish with ageing.
From nine hours of sleep per night at the age of 12 the average sleep needs decrease to eight hours at the age of 20, seven hours at 40, 6 1/2 hours at 60 and 6 hours at 80.
Although difficulty in staying asleep is the most common type of insomnia, the single symptom that most frequently makes the onset of insomnia is the difficulty in falling asleep.
Other symptoms are emotional instability, loss of coordination, confusion and a lingering feeling of indifference.
The most common cause of sleeplessness is mental tension brought about by anxiety, worries, overwork and overexcitement.
Suppressed feelings of resentment, anger and bitterness may also cause insomnia.
Constipation, dyspepsia, overeating at night, excessive intake of starches, sweets, tea or coffee and going to bed hungry are among the other causes.
Smoking is another unsuspected cause of insomnia as it irritates the nervous system, especially the nerves of the digestive system.
Environment factors such as overcrowding, excessive noise and poor bedding or housing conditions may also lead to transient sleep difficulties.
Often, worrying about falling asleep is enough to keep one awake.
In the acute stage of influenza, the patient should abstain from all solid foods and only drink fruit and vegetable juices diluted with water, in the proportion of 50 : 50 for the first three to five days, depending on the severity of the disease.
Sleeping pills are no remedy for sleeplessness.
They are habit-forming and become less effective when taken continuously.
The side-effects of sleeping pills include indigestion, skin rashes, lowered resistance to infection, circulatory and respiratory problems, poor appetite, high blood pressure, kidney and liver problems and mental confusion.
Diet is an important factor in the treatment of insomnia.
Research has shown that people with chronic insomnia almost have marked deficiencies of such key nutrients as B-complex vitamins and vitamin C and D, also calcium, magnesium, manganese, potassium and zinc.
The sleep mechanism is unable to function efficiently unless each of these nutrients is present in adequate amounts in the diet.
Of the various food elements, thiamine or vitamin B1 is of special significance.
It is vital for strong, healthy nerves.
A body starved for thiamine over a long period will be unable to relax sufficiently to induce natural sleep.
The valuable sources of this vitamin are whole grain cereals, pulses and nuts.
The juice fast should be continued till the temperature comes down to normal.
A balanced diet with simple modifications in the eating pattern will go a long way in the treatment of insomnia.
Such diet should exclude white flour products, sugar and its products, tea, coffee, chocolate, cola drinks, alcohol, fatty foods, fried foods, foods containing additives, preservatives, colouring and flavouring, excessive use of salt and strong condiments.
The patient may adopt an all-fruit diet for three or four days at the beginning of the treatment.
In this regimen, he should have three meals a day of fresh juicy fruits such as oranges, grapes, apples, pears, peaches, and pineapples.
This will help cleanse the blood stream and relieve possible digestive and intestinal disturbances.
The bowels should be cleansed daily with a warm water enema during this period.
After the all-fruit diet, the patient may follow a modified eating pattern in which breakfast should consist of fresh and dried fruits, seeds and yogurt.
Of the two main meals, one should consist of a large mixed salad and the other should be protein based.
A cup of milk sweetened with honey at bedtime is helpful as the amino acid tryptophan contained in the milk induces sleep.
Celery is also considered beneficial in the treatment of insomnia.
A warm water enema should be taken daily during this period to cleanse the bowels.
Taking meals late in the night often leads to sleeplessness.
The sufferer from insomnia should, therefore, eat his last meal at least three hours before going to bed.
Food should never be taken when one is emotionally disturbed or suffering from fatigue or acute depression as it will result in gastric discomfort.
Those suffering from insomnia should always take meals in a relaxed atmosphere.
This is important at any time of the day, but more especially at night.
Along with dietary treatment, other effective measures should also be adopted to overcome the problem.
These include application of hot fomentation to the spine, hot foot bath or an alternate hot and cold foot bath and prolonged neutral immersion bath (92* to 96*F) at bedtime.
All efforts should also be made to eliminate as many stress factors as possible.
The steps in this direction should include regular practice of any relaxation method or meditation technique, cultivating the art of doing thing slowly, particularly activities like eating, walking and talking, limiting the working day to nine or ten hours, and 5 1/2 days weekly, cultivating a creative hobby and spending some time daily on this.
Jaundice is the most common of all liver disorders.
After fever subsides, the patient may adopt an all-fruit diet for two or three days.
It is a condition in which yellow discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes occurs due to an increase in the bile pigment, bilirubin, in the blood.
The bile, produced by the liver, is a vital digestive fluid which is essential for proper nutrition.
It exercises a most favourable influence on the general processes of digestion.
It also prevents decaying changes in food.
If the bile is prevented from entering the intestines there is an increase in gases and other products.
Normally, the production of bile and its flow is constant.
The symptoms of jaundice are extreme weakness, headache, fever, loss of appetite, undue fatigue, severe constipation, nausea and yellow coloration of the eyes, tongue, skin and urine.
The patient may also feel a dull pain in the liver region.
Obstructive jaundice may be associated with intense itching.
Jaundice is indicative of the malfunctioning of the liver.
In this regimen, the patient should take three meals a day of fresh juicy fruits such as apples, pears, grapes, oranges, pineapples, peaches and melons at five-hourly intervals.
It may be caused by an obstruction of the bile ducts which discharge bile salts and pigment into the intestines.
The bile then gets mixed with blood and this gives a yellow pigmentation to the skin.
The obstruction of the bile ducts could be due to gall-stones or inflammation of the liver, known as hepatitis, caused by a virus.
In the latter case, the virus spreads and may lead to epidemics owing to overcrowding, dirty surroundings, unsanitary conditions and contamination of food and water.
Other causes of jaundice are pernicious, anaemia and certain diseases affecting the liver such as typhoid, malaria, yellow fever and tuberculosis.
The simple form of jaundice can be cured rapidly by diet therapy and exercises.
Recovery will, however, be slow in serious cases which have been caused by obstruction or pressure in the bile ducts.
The patient should rest until the acute symptoms of the disease subside.
The patient should be put on a juice fast for a week.
The juices of oranges, lemons, grapes, pears, carrots, beets and sugarcane can be taken.
The juice fast may be continued till the acute symptoms subside.
30. One cup of barley should be boiled in six pints of water and simmered for three hours.
The duration of the attack varies with each individual.
Digestive disturbances must be avoided.
No food with a tendency to ferment or putrefy in the lower intestines like pulses and legumes should be included in the diet.
Drinking a lot of water with lemon juice will protect the damaged liver cells.
The jaundice patient can overcome the condition quite easily with the above regime and build up his sick liver until it functions normally once again.
A recurrence of liver trouble can be prevented with reasonable care in the diet and life style, with regular, moderate exercise and frequent exposure to sunshine, fresh air and adequate rest.
Research has shown that the liver has an excellent capacity to regenerate itself provided all essential nutrients are adequately supplied.
Diets high in complete proteins, vitamin C, and B vitamins, particularly choline, and vitamin E can hasten its regeneration.
Even after recovery, it is essential to maintain the diet for a long period to prevent recurrence of the trouble.
Cirrhosis of the liver refers to all forms of liver disease characterised by a significant loss of cells.
After the juice fast, the patient may adopt an all-fruit diet for further three to five days.
It is one of the most serious hepatic diseases.
The liver gradually contracts in size and becomes hard and leathery.
The liver is one of the most important glandular organs in the body.
It is located high up on the right side of the abdomen just under the diaphragm.
It is a vast chemical laboratory which performs many important functions.
It produces bile, cholesterol, lecithin, blood albumin which is vital to the removal of tissue wastes, prothrombin necessary for the clotting of blood and numerous enzymes.
It inactivates hormones no longer needed, synthesises many amino acids used in building tissues and breaks proteins into sugar and fat when required for energy.
It stores vitamins and minerals.
It also destroys harmful substances and detoxifies drugs, poisons, chemicals and toxins from bacterial infections.
Liver damage interferes with all of these functions.
In this regimen, he should have three meals a day of fresh juicy fruits such as apples, pears, grapes, oranges, and pineapples, but no bananas.
In cirrhosis of the liver, although regenerative activity continues, the loss of liver cells exceeds cell replacement.
There is also distortion of the vascular system which interferes with the portal blood flow through the liver.
The progressive degeneration of liver structure and function may ultimately lead to hepatic failure and death.
The most common of several form of cirrhosis is portal cirrhosis, also known as haennoc's cirrhosis.
In the early stages of the disease, there may be nothing more than frequent attacks of gas and indigestion, with occasional nausea and vomiting.
There may be some abdominal pain and loss of weight.
In the advanced stage, the patient develops a low grade fever.
He has a foul breath, jaundiced skin and distended veins in the abdomen.
Reddish hair like markings, resembling small spiders, may appear on the face, neck, arms and trunk.
The abdomen becomes bloated and swollen, the mind gets clouded and there may be considerable bleeding from the stomach.
All fats like ghee, butter, cream and oils must be avoided for atleast two weeks, and after that butter and olive oil may be included in the diet but their consumption should be kept down to the minimum.
Excessive use of alcohol over a long period is the most potent cause of cirrhosis of the liver.
It has been estimated that 1 out of 12 chronic alcoholics in the United States develops cirrhosis.
The disease can progress to the end-stage of hepatic failure, if the person does not abstain from alcohol.
Cirrhosis appears to be related to the duration of alcohol intake and the quantity consumed daily.
Recent research indicates that the average duration of alcohol intake to produce cirrhosis is 10 years and the dose is estimated to be in excess of 16 ounces of alcohol daily.
Poor nutrition can be another causative factor in the development of cirrhosis and a chronic alcoholic usually suffers from a severe malnutrition too, as he seldom eats.
Other causes of cirrhosis are excessive intake of highly seasoned food, habitual taking of quinine for a prolonged period in tropical climate and drug treatments for syphilis, fever and other diseases.
It may also result from a highly toxic condition of the system in general.
In fact, anything which continually over-burdens the liver cells and leads to their final breakdown can be a contributing cause of the cirrhosis.
The patient should be kept in bed.
A light carbohydrate diet, with exclusion of fats, best obtained from vegetables and fruits should be taken.
He must abstain completely from alcohol in any form.
He should undergo an initial liver cleaning programme with a juice fast for seven days.
Freshly-extracted juices from red beets, lemon, papaya and grapes may be taken during this period.
This may be followed by the fruit and milk diet for two to three weeks.
In this regimen, the patient should have three meals a day of fresh juicy fruits and milk.
The fruits may include apples, pears, grapes, grapefruits, oranges, pineapples and peaches.
Two pints of milk may be taken on the first day.
It should be increased by half a pint daily up to four or five pints a day.
It should be sipped very slowly.
After the fruit and milk diet, the patient may gradually embark upon well-balanced diet of three basic foods with emphasis on raw organically-grown foods.
The patient should take plenty of fresh vegetables and fruit juices.
Adequate high quality protein is necessary in cirrhosis.
The best complete proteins for liver patients are obtained from raw goat's milk, home-made raw cottage cheese, sprouted seeds and grains and raw nuts, especially almonds.
Vegetables such as beet, squashes, bitter gourds, egg-plants, tomatoes, carrots, radishes and papayas are useful in this condition.
All fats and oils should be excluded from the diet for several weeks.
The patient should avoid all refined, processed and canned foods, sugar in any form, spices and condiments, strong tea and coffee, fried foods, all preparations cooked in ghee, oil or butter and all meats rich in fat.
The use of salt should be restricted.
The patient should also avoid all chemical additives in food and poisons in air, water and environment as far as possible.
A warm water enema should be used during the treatment to cleanse the bowels.
If constipation is chronic, all steps should be taken for its eradication.
Application of alternate compress to liver area followed by general wet sheet rub will be beneficial.
27. Dandelion leaves, radishes with leaves, endive should be added to the daily raw vegetable salad.
The morning dry friction and breathing and other exercises should form regular daily features of the treatment.
Migraine is an ancient and formidable malady.
It bothered such distinguished persons as Caesar, Darwin and Freud.
It has assumed alarming proportions under modern conditions of living and is now believed to afflict about 10 per cent of the world's population.
Migraine can be defined as a paroxysmal affliction, accompanied by severe headache, generally on one side of the head and associated with disorders of the digestion, the liver and the vision.
It usually occurs when the person is under great mental tension or has suddenly got over that state.
For them, everything has to be done right away and when they finish; they come down suddenly from a state of utmost mental tension to a feeling of great relief.
The head and neck muscles, reacting from continuous stress become overworked.
The tight muscles squeeze the arteries and reduce blood flow.
Then, when the person relaxes suddenly, the constricted muscles expand, stretching the blood-vessel wall.
28. Raw apples and pears are especially beneficial.
With each heartbeat, the blood pushes through these vessels and expands them further, causing intense pain.
Migraine headaches are believed to be related to the daily cycle of adrenal hormone secretion.
Adrenal hormone levels are at their peak during the morning and taper off during the evening, reaching a low level around 3 am An important function of these hormones is to regulate vascular muscle tone and to prevent vasocodilation.
When adrenal hormones production is low, blood vessels are more prone to dilation.
Thus migraine headaches are generally triggered in the evening and rarely in the morning.
There is a definite pattern for migraine.
The pain rages on only one side of the head and often radiates from the eye.
The right side of the head may be affected in one attack and in the next it may be the left side.
Migraine attacks are usually preceded by a short period of depression, irritability and loss of appetite.
Some persons get attacks daily, others every month or every two or three months and still others only once or twice in several years.
29. Barley water, drunk several times during the day, is considered a good remedy for jaundice.
Migraine is also known as sick headache.
The main symptoms are a pounding pain, nausea and vomiting.
The blood vessels on the affected side of the head will be prominent and pulsating.
Migraine gives fair warning before striking.
The patient sees flashes of light or black spots or only parts of the objects in front of him.
He may also feel numbness or weakness in an arm or leg, or on one side of the face.
Sometimes the numbness may affect both sides of the face and tongue and whole mouth, making speech slurred and difficult.
As the headache develops, disturbed digestion becomes a marked feature.
A severe attack of migraine is very tiring and the patient may have to rest in bed so as to exclude light and noise as far as possible, because both cause painful irritations.
The whole of the head becomes hypersensitive and even the slightest movement adds to the intense pain.
Some may get over the acute symptoms in a matter of hours.
Other triggers include excessive bright light, eye-strain, excitement, fright, hurry, anger, resentment and depression after hard work.
The patient with this condition may find it very difficult to walk in the darkness.
Painkilling drugs may give temporary relief but they do not remove the cause.
The patient soon gets addicted to strong drugs which also lose their effectiveness in course of time.
The best treatment for migraine is to prevent it.
Any successful treatment for this ailment should, therefore, aim at a complete toning up and revitalisation of the whole organism To achieve this, it will be essential to under-take a thorough cleansing of the system and adopt vitality-building measures.
To begin with, the patient should resort to fasting on orange juice and water for two or three days.
The procedure is to take the juice of an orange in a glass of a warm water every two hours from 8 am to 8 pm Alternatively, juices of vegetables such as carrot, cucumber and celery may be taken.
A warm water enema may be taken each day while fasting to cleanse the bowels.
After the short juice fast, the patient may adopt an all-fruit diet for about five days, taking three meals a day of fresh juicy fruits such as apples, pears, grapes, grapefruits, oranges, pineapples, peaches and melons.
Others may require a day's rest to come to a normal state.
NO other food stuff should be taken during this period; otherwise the value of the whole treatment will be lost.
After the all-fruit diet, the sufferer should follow a well-balanced diet of three basic food groups, namely seeds, nuts and grains, vegetables and fruits.
This diet should be supplemented with milk, yogurt, butter-milk, vegetable oils and honey.
Further short fasts or periods on the all-fruit diet may be necessary at intervals of a month or two, according to the needs of the case.
If constipation is habitual, all steps should be taken towards its eradication.
The foods which should be avoided in future are white flour products, sugar, confectionary, rich cakes, pastries, sweets, refined cereals, flesh foods, rich heavy and greasy foods, tinned or preserved foods, pickles, condiments and sauces.
Too much cereal should also be avoided.
The patient should eat six small meals rather than a few large ones.
Overeating should be avoided.
Niacin especially, has proved helpful in the treatment of migraine.
Still others, who are less fortunate, may drag on for two, three, or even four days.
It is, however, necessary that when taking any of the separate B vitamin factors, the entire B-complex should be taken in some form as too much of one factor can throw the other factors into imbalance.
This may result in other undesirable problems.
In fact, the entire B-complex range is beneficial in the prevention of migraine.
Drinking lots of water, hot foot baths, fomentations over the stomach and spine, cold compress ( 40*F to 60*F) to the head and towels wrung out of very hot water and frequently applied to the neck will go a long way in relieving migraine headaches.
The patient should also undertake plenty of exercise and walking in fresh air.
Nephritis refers to an inflammation of the kidneys.
It is a serious condition and may be either acute or chronic.
This disease most often strikes in childhood or adolescence.
It can become progressively worse and result in death, if not treated properly in the initial stages.
In the alternative, it may subside into a chronic stage where the patient gets better but not well.
Migraine may result from a variety of causes such as low blood sugar, allergy, infection, excessive intake of certain drugs like vitamin A, weak constitution, low energy, nutritional deficiency, overwork, improper sleep and rest, excessive smoking, drinking and sex.
Often the urine may contain blood, albumin and casts consisting of clumps of red and white cells which come from the damaged kidneys.
The patient suffers from puffiness in the face and swelling of the feet and ankles.
In the chronic stage of nephritis, which may drag on for many years, the patient passes large amounts of albumin in the urine.
Later, there may be a rise in the blood pressure and the patient may develop uraemia.
There may be frequent urination, especially during night.
Nephritis usually follows some streptococcus infection of the throat or an attack of scarlet fever or rheumatic fever.
The underlying causes of nephritis are the same for diseases of the kidneys in general, namely wrong food habits, excessive drinking, suppressive medical treatment of some former diseases, the habitual use of chemical agents of all kinds for the treatment of indigestion and other stomach disorders and frequent use of aspirin and other painkillers.
Nutritional deficiencies can also lead to nephritis.
The disease has been produced in many species of animals by diets deficient in the B vitamin choline.
Animals lacking in essential fatty acids and magnesium also develop nephritis.
Menstruation in women may also be one of the important causes of migraine due to the effect of chemical hormone changes occurring during this period.
When vitaminB6 and magnesium are under supplied, the kidneys are further damaged by sharp crystals of oxalic acid combined with calcium.
Nephritis also occurs if vitamin E is deficient.
The safest treatment for acute nephritis is fasting.
By means of the fast, the toxins and systemic impurities responsible for setting up of the inflammatory kidney conditions are removed rapidly.
The patient should resort to juice fasting for seven to ten days till the acute symptoms subside.
Mostly, vegetable juices such as carrot, celery and cucumber should be used during this period.
A warm water enema should be taken each day while fasting to cleanse the bowels of the toxic matter thrown off by the self-cleansing process resulting from the fast.
After the juice fast, the patient may adopt an all-fruit diet for four or five days.
Juicy fruits such as apples, grapes, oranges, pears, peaches and pineapples should be taken during this period at five-hourly intervals.
After the all-fruit diet, the patient may adopt a fruit and milk diet.
This form of migraine is usually eliminated with menopause.
In this regimen, milk, preferably raw goat's milk may be added to the fruit diet mentioned above for further seven days.
The patient may, thereafter, gradually embark upon a well-balanced low-protein vegetarian diet, with emphasis on fresh fruits and raw and cooked vegetables.
In case of chronic nephritis a short juice fast for three days may be undertaken.
Thereafter, a week or ten days may be spent on a restricted diet.
In this regimen, oranges or orange juice may be taken for breakfast.
Lunch may consist of a salad of raw vegetables in season, with olive oil and lemon juice dressing and dinner may consist of one or two vegetables steamed in their own juices and a few nuts.
Thereafter, the patient may gradually adopt a well- balanced low-protein vegetarian diet.
Further short juice fast followed by a week on the restricted diet should be undertaken at intervals of two or three months until the kidney condition has shown signs of normalisation.
The patient should avoid vegetables containing large quantities of oxalic acid such as spinach and rhubarb.
Chocolate and cocoa also contain oxalic acid and must not be taken.
There are various factors which trigger off migraine.
Garlic, asparagus, parsley, watercress, cucumber and celery are excellent vegetables.
Best fruits are papaya and bananas.
Both have a healing effect on the kidneys.
A small amount of soured milk and home-made cottage cheese can be included in the diet.
All salt should be eliminated from the diet.
Five or six small meals should be taken in preference to a few large ones.
The diet should be adequate in all essential nutrients.
Supplements should be given to furnish the nutrients not obtained from food.
The supplements may include one tablespoon of lecithin, 30 mg. of vitamin B6, 25,000 Ius of vitamin A, and 300 to 600 Ius of vitamin E.
Smoking and drinking, where habitual, must be completely given up.
The most important is consuming food which the patient may be allergic to.
Studies have shown that smoking impairs kidney function.
The patient should avoid white bread, sugar, cakes, pastries, puddings, refined cereals, greasy, and fried foods.
He should also avoid tea, coffee, all flesh foods, condiments, pickles and sauces.
All measures should be adopted to relieve the kidneys of work by increasing elimination through other channels.
A hot Epsom salt bath should be taken every alternate day to induce elimination through the skin as much as possible.
Fresh air and outdoor exercises will be of great benefit in all cases of nephritis and where possible, the patient should walk for at least three kilometres once or twice daily.
He should avoid all hurry and excitement.
He should also avoid late hours.
If the above treatment is faithfully carried out, the patient of acute nephritis will soon be on the way to recovery.
Even in advanced cases of chronic nephritis a great deal can be done to improve the sufferer's condition by perseverance, with the treatment outlined above.
Such foods include certain chocolates, cheese and other dairy products, fried foods in general, onions, tomatoes, citrus fruits as well as coffee, tea, nicotine and alcoholic drinks which stimulate or depress the nerves and alter the size of blood vessels.
Neuritis is one of the most serious nervous disorders.
It refers to an inflammation of the nerves, involving a single nerve or a series of nerves.
At times, several different groups of nerves in various parts of the body may be involved.
This condition is known as polyneuritis.
It is also known as Polyneuropathy, for strictly speaking, the condition is not an inflammation, but a change in the state of the nerves resulting in weakness of the reflexes and changes of sensation.
The main symptoms of neuritis are tingling and burning and stabbing pains in the affected nerves.
In severe cases there may be numbness and loss of sensation and paralysis of the nearby muscles.
Thus, temporary paralysis of the face may result from changes in the facial nerves on the affected side.
During the acute stage of this condition, the patient may not be able to close the eyes due to loss of normal tone and strength in the muscles on the affected side of the face.
Neuritis may also be caused by pernicious anaemia, involving the nerves of the spine.
The chief cause of neuritis is chronic acidosis, that is, an excessive acidic condition of the blood and other body fluids.
The best treatment for neuritis is to ensure that the patient gets optimum nutrition, well assimilated with all the vitamins and other nutrients.
On this you can build your wealth and sound financial, social, moral, mental and spiritual style of life.
The diet should be made up of three basic food groups, namely seeds, nuts and grains, vegetables and fruits, with special emphasis on whole grains, particularly whole wheat, brown rice, raw and sprouted seeds, raw milk, especially in the sore form and home-made cheese.
In this regimen, the breakfast may consist of fresh fruits, handful of raw nuts or a couple of tablespoons of sunflower and pumpkin seeds.
Steamed vegetables, whole wheat chapattis and a glass of butter milk may be taken for lunch.
The dinner may comprise a large bowl of fresh, green vegetable salad, fresh home-made cottage cheese, fresh butter and a glass of butter-milk.
In severe cases, the patient should be put on a short juice fast for four or five days before being given the optimum diet.
Carrots, beets, citrus fruits, apples and pineapples may be used for juices.
All vitamins of the B group have proved highly beneficial in the prevention and treatment of neuritis.
The patient should not eat white bread, white sugar, refined cereals, meat, fish, tinned foods, tea, coffee and condiments which form the root of the trouble by continuously flooding the tissues with acid impurities.
The patient should be given two or three hot Epsom salt baths weekly, and should be asked to remain in the bath for 25 to 30 minutes.
All the body fluids should be alkaline in their reaction, but when the acid waste matter is continuously formed in the tissues over a long period due to a faulty diet, it results in acidosis.
The affected part should also be bathed several times daily in hot water containing Epsom salt - a table- spoon of salt to a cupful of hot water.
The patient should undertake walking and other moderate exercises.
Obesity may be described as a bodily condition characterised by excessive storage of fat in the adipose tissues.
It usually results from consumption of food in excess of physiological needs.
Obesity is common among people in Western countries and among the higher income groups in India and other developing countries.
Obesity can occur at any age in either sex.
Its incidence is higher in persons who consume more food and lead sedentary lives.
In women, obesity is liable to occur after pregnancy and at menopause.
A woman usually gains about 12 kgs. of weight during pregnancy.
Part of this is an increase in the adipose tissue which serves as a store against the demands of lactation.
Wrong habits of living, over- work, etc, lower the tone of the nervous system and contribute towards neuritis.
Many women gain more and retain a part of this weight.
They become progressively obese with each succeeding child.
Obesity is generally assessed by relating the patient's weight to charts of standard weight according to age, sex and height and then categorise them as 10, 20, or 30 per cent over-weight.
However, normal weight depends on body build and some people, who inherit a large frame and bulk muscles, may weigh more than the standard weight, without being obese.
A more scientific assessment of obesity would, therefore, be by the proportion of fat in the total body weight.
Mean values of body fat for the normal young men are about 12 per cent and for young women about 26 per cent.
A man whose body fat amounts to more than 20 per cent of his total weight may be regarded obese and for a woman a figure of more than 30 per cent represents obesity.
Obesity is a serious health hazard as the extra fat puts a strain on the heart, kidneys and liver as well as the large weight-bearing joints such as the hips, knees and ankles, which ultimately shortens the life span.
It has been truly said, "the longer the belt, the shorter the life".
Overweight persons are susceptible to several diseases like coronary thrombosis, heart failure, high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, gout and liver and gall-bladder disorders.
The disease can also result from a variety of nutritional deficiencies and metabolic disturbances such as faulty calcium metabolism, deficiencies of several B vitamins like B12, B6, B1, Pantothenic acid and B2 and general toxaemia.
The chief cause of obesity, most often, is overeating - that is, the intake of calories beyond the body's energy requirement.
Some people have a habit of eating too much while others may be in the habit of consuming high- calorie foods.
These people gain weight continuously as they fail to adjust their appetite to reduced energy requirements.
There has, in recent times, been an increasing awareness of the psychological aspects of obesity.
Persons who are generally bored, unhappy, lonely or unloved, those who are discontented with their families, or social or financial standing usually tend to overeat, as eating is a pleasure and solace to them
Obesity is sometimes also the result of disturbances of the thyroid or pituitary glands.
But glandular disorders account for only about two per cent of the total incidence of obesity.
In such persons the basal metabolic rate is low and they keep gaining weight unless they take a low- calorie diet.
A suitably planned course of dietetic treatment, in conjunction with suitable exercise and other measures for promoting elimination, is the only scientific way of dealing with obesity.
The chief consideration in this treatment should be the balanced selection of foods which provide the maximum essential nutrients with the least number of calories.
Other causes of neuritis include a blow, a penetrating injury, a bad bruise or heavy pressure over a nerve trunk and dislocation or fracture of the bones.
To begin with, the patient should undertake a juice fast for seven to ten days, juices of lemon, grapefruit, orange, pineapple, cabbage, and celery may be taken during this period.
Long juice fast up to forty days can also be undertaken, but only under expert guidance and supervision.
In the alternative, short juice fasts should be repeated at regular intervals of two months or so till the desired reduction in weight is achieved.
During the first few days of the treatment and afterwards if necessary, the bowels should be cleansed daily with a warm water enema.
After the juice fast, the patient should spend a further four to five days on all-fruit diet.
In this regimen he should have three meals a day of fresh juicy fruits such as oranges, grape-fruit, pineapples and papayas.
Thereafter, he may gradually embark upon a low-calorie well- balanced diet of three basic food groups, namely seeds, nuts and grains, vegetables and fruits, with emphasis on raw fruits, vegetables and fresh juices.
The foods which should be drastically curtailed or altogether avoided are high-fat foods such as butter, cheese, chocolate, cream, ice cream, fat meats, fried foods, foods high in carbohydrates like breads, candy, cake, cookies, cereal products, legumes, potatoes, honey, sugar, syrup and rich puddings ; beverages such as all cold drinks and alcoholic drinks.
To overcome the hunger pangs brought on by a lowered consumption of food, the patient should sip water gradually or take low-calorie and high-water foods like vegetables and certain fruits.
Skimmed milk, butter- milk, barley water, fruit juices, green steamed vegetables and raw salads are good for reducing weight.
Any violent muscular activity or over extension of the joint as in sprains may injure the nerves and cause neuritis.
Six to eight glasses of water should be taken every day but never with meals.
Fletcherism - One sure method of reducing weight is by practising what is known as " Fletcherism".
It was discovered in 1898 by Horace Fletcher of the U.S A.
He was 50 pounds overweight, contracted flu every six months and constantly complained of indigestion and a tired feeling.
Fletchet considered complete mastication as the most important rule of all.
He tried fixing an ideal number at first but found that chewing less than thirty times per mouthful was insufficient.
Consequently, he decided that chewing food to a pulp or liquid should become the standard.
Horace Fletcher followed these rules for five months.
As a result he lost more than 60 pounds and felt better than he had for 20 years.
A weight reducing programme built on Fletcherism works wonders and is worth a trial.
The condition may also result from certain infections such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, leprosy and diabetes mellitus, poisoning with insecticides, mercury, lead, arsenic and alcohol.
It is important that the overweight person should so devise his diet as to lose weight gradually - a pound in a week or ten days.
This will enable him to get used to the new eating habits.
Along with dietetic treatment, the patient should adopt all other natural methods of reducing weight.
Exercise is an important part of weight reduction plan.
It helps to use up calories stored in body fat and relieves tension, besides toning up the muscles of the body.
Certain yogic asana such as sarvngasana, bhujangasana, dhanurasana, chakrasana, vajrasana and yogamudra are also highly beneficial.
They help slimming by breaking up or redistributing fatty deposits and strengthen the flabby areas.
The patient should adopt measures which bring on excessive perspiration such as sauna baths, steam bath and heavy massage.
They help to reduce weight.
And above all, the obese persons should make every effort to avoid negative emotions such as anxiety, fear, hostility and insecurity and develop a positive outlook on life.
Treatment of neuritis by painkilling drugs may give temporary relief but it does not remove the trouble effectively.
You have zest for living.
There are only a few who want to keep their health vibrant till their end.
Such people become old and feeble before time.
Day by day, year by year, as we grow to maturity we must think of piling up our health capital in the bank of health.
These funds, we can use freely under expert guidance.
With a planned outlook on health, we can spend our energy profitably.
We will grow strong and more complete as human beings.
We can "spend" our health energy and still regain what we lost or even add to the vital riches.
This can be done only through intelligent direction.
The knowledge essential to keep the body, bouncing, surging and vigorous must be understood and closely followed.
The pain is relieved for the time being at the cost of the health of other parts of the body, especially the heart and kidneys, and the neuritis remains.
Wasteful habits are condemned.
A spendthrift hardly gets worthwhile enjoyment out of life.
Being a spendthrift in the principles of good health may lead you to complete breakdown.
Spend your life carefully.
You cannot keep it in a bank as you deposit your money.
Good health is something you can carry around with you.
It will give a bloom to your complexion and put a song in your heart.
It will bring you opportunities, get you friends and love.
You should aim at looking and feeling young when you are old.
A buoyant, dynamic health is a big treasure.
Do not worry when you feel sick or unwell.
If you lose all hope, you will keep on worrying and you will feel that all failures and sufferings have been heaped by Karma on you.
Only with good health can they enjoy and have fun and the fruits of life.
You will feel that the world has become your enemy.
The biggest enemy cannot harm you so much as you can harm yourself through such pessimism.
It is the weakest who lose in a struggle.
You must try to struggle and win.
It will give you bigger strength.
It will be a source of pride and stimulation and help you towards bigger achievements.
Nature has given man, ambition, the urge to conquer.
She has equipped him for struggle, with hopes and dreams.
Through the understanding of the past, he profits for tomorrow's work through the use of a dynamic and vital mind.
Do not think that this treasure of good health is beyond your reach.
The power to fulfil is in him.
He needs to triumph and he must triumph.
Life will not accept anything less of him and let him live in peace and happiness.
Every man can be successful in his own field of life.
No power or circumstances can entirely frustrate him.
No fate can doom him to despair.
The hope, the vision, the dream, he can fulfil them all.
Yet success cannot be achieved by mind alone, for mind cannot exist or function without the body.
It is foolish to think that the mind can be cultivated at the expense of the body.
It is like destroying the candle to save the candle light.
Be prepared for hard work.
A movement of physical culture idea has become vitally necessary in modern life.
It is foolish to ask which is more important - the body or the mind.
The two are closely inter-related and interwoven.
Any effort to develop one at the cost of other will be self-defeating.
Greeks are known as founders of western civilization.
They based their civilization on gymnastics and music.
For them gymnastics meant the building of fine bodies by regular exercise done naked.
Music which included poetry and drama meant the training of the mind and release of emotion.
If one was physically and emotionally developed, according to their theory, he was educated.
India went beyond this and invented yoga and meditation, and delved into the vastness of mind power.
Be patient and persistent.
Yoga asana exercises made the body fit and healthy, then went deeper into the unknown recesses of the mind by meditation to know its vast power to control the body.
Now it has been proved beyond doubt that in many diseases the mind is the culprit or that it plays a major role.
If the mind can be controlled the disease can also be controlled.
Frighten a man and his heart will beat more rapidly.
Make him happy and you will notice a sparkle in his eyes and a glow on his cheeks.
Teach him better ways to think and his power to act effectively increases.
Improve the vitality of his body and his mind is energised and quickened.
An improved co-ordination of mind leads to greater mental accuracy.
An effective body means effective thinking.
Ability to act surely and well gives the ability to act surely and swiftly.
You will soon see that you can come out of your sickness; your vigour will go on increasing, your zest for life gradually will fill you up, you will again begin to feel optimistic.
They have co-ordinated muscles which means they are perfectly under the control of their mind.
People who have the finest brains have been good athletes also.
George Washington could in a long jump cover 22 feet.
something that only about one in ten thousand are able to perform.
Lord Byron was known to have club feet.
He was as good as his poetry.
Napoleon was a man of small stature.
Obesity and over eating shortened his life, yet he was of tremendous energy, he habitually worked 18 hours a day.
Tennyson was described as fine looking.
Wordsworth was handsome and had heroic proportions.
Do not be in a hurry.
Walter Scott had the frame of herculean proportions.
Tolstoy was an excellent swimmer even at sixty-five.
He learnt to ride a bicycle at the age of sixty-six.
When he was fifty he walked 130 miles in 3 days.
Some of these men had pet illnesses and yet they were not weaklings.
Herbert Spencer was nervous, an insomniac with a bad digestion, Yet he lived to be eighty.
His real trouble was that because he could not stop thinking he found it hard to sleep.
Gandhiji was quite lean and thin.
He could work long hours and was a regular walker.
The size and shape of the head has little to do with brain power.
One gets sick after years of wasteful and negligent life.
The largest brain weighs 3 lbs.
Many men of genius had brains unusually large, but there were also those whose brains were actually under the average size.
Persons who devote their entire life to physical development are likely to have a better physique than say those who lead sedentary lives, like scientists, lawyers or doctors.
A harmonious development of both body and mind most frequently wins the game of life.
Some people do not seem to realise that physical life in itself is worth all our effort.
Many hold the view that the accumulation of wealth is of a dominating importance.
In its quest they may tend to ignore the need for physical fitness.
They may come to regret as time pass by.
The man who commits suicide claims that life is not worth living.
Those who do not care for their health also commit suicide, slowly and painfully.
Improvement also comes in at a slow and steady pace.
There are people who reduce their physical activity to a minimum, hoping to gain time for the pursuit of wealth.
This philosophy defeats itself.
Temporarily, the man who neglects his body may gain time for other affairs.
If no immediate bad effects follow, he feels that he has an edge over the man who devotes time and thought to cultivate his body.
Temporarily, the man who neglects his body does gain time for other activities.
The habit of laziness is created first by the non-physical demand of life.
Then the habit of neglect becomes a force in itself to discourage the return to a physically active life.
Thus a vicious circle of body neglect is established.
The condition drifts from bad to worse, usually, until some pronounced break in health sets in and causes interference to his mental or financial achievements.
Only then pain and fear force a realization of the mistake he has made by neglecting the well-being of the body.
The most important thing is that you should be hopeful.
There is belated and blind stampede then, in the quest of good health.
Nature has not intended man to become ill.
This unfortunately happens when there is suppression of natural activity and perversion of instincts.
Once the health is impaired, no matter how, nature does attempt to repair the damage just as it heals the cut on the body surface.
In this, nature can be helped to help the body.
Prevention is better than cure.
Those who are deficient in health and then regain it realise that prevention is better than cure.
If the loss of health can be prevented it is better and such a person has better reasons to be grateful to nature.
Preventing disease and building health are the primary ends, cure comes next.
Those who are wealthy know the need for survival because the building of their financial empire is less important than the building of their health to enjoy this wealth.
The body is the most beautiful creation of God.
It is natural to be well as to be born.
This may be attributed to the fact that his mother fell asleep as Arjun explained the intricacies of how he came out of the enemy formation.
All pathological conditions, all diseases and all tendencies to diseases are the result of the transgression of physiologic and hygienic law.
This is the science of health in a nutshell.
With the passage of time we have come to know that it is not so.
Penicillin has its own limitations.
Every 2-3 years we develop a new generation of mycin and in 2-3 years they become ineffective due to growth of resistant bacteria.
They help to check infection no doubt, but they cause side effects.
With the arrival of cancer and Aids we have come to realize the limitations of drugs.
We know that the food we eat and environmental hazards are responsible for cancer.
More fat in the diet and lack of fibre causes cancer.
It has its own mechanism to fight diseases.
New research is on to develop treatment within our body - through antibody reaction, relying on the body's immune system.
If we are not careful with our food, exercise and relaxation, inspite of our best scientific knowledge, new diseases will keep on cropping up.
Do not rush to the doctor when you get fever, wait for 2-3 days, it may subside by itself.
When you have fever the antibody formation goes up over 20 times more at 400C (1020F).
This means that the body is gearing up to fight for itself.
Do not take medicines for minor ailments like cold or headaches, wait and see, many a times these will disappear within days.
Cold is a viral infection, it will take 5-7 days to make itself scarce whether you take drugs or not.
In fact, no medicine is effective for viral infection.
Most innocent looking drugs are not so innocent, they have side effects.
Choose a good doctor who prescribes minimum drugs.
It is a self-maintaining machine and it is self-sustaining.
A correct diagnosis depends on his expertise and skill.
This is why it is better to wait for 2-3 days and have a proper diagnosis before treatment, give the body a chance to cure itself.
Yoga is coming to the rescue of medical science in many ways.
The hold of the mind over matter has become the magic of the modern era.
For century's yogis of India practiced self-control.
They have been able to cure illnesses that doctors were unable to.
They believe in bio feedback and their key phrase is "patient heal thyself".
Experiments show that with the aid of sensitive machines, patients can control certain body functions, previously thought to be uncontrollable.
Scientists have found the illnesses connected with the heart, brain, muscle groups and circulatory systems can be overcome, if not cured completely, by bio feedback which is connected with our ability to control alpha brain waves and the electro impulses from the limbic system located just below the cortex.
Scientists in 1935 said that the alpha waves normally occur when our eyes are closed for some time, when we stare into the distance.
It can run itself efficiently and can do its repairs when need arises.
The brain normally produces only beta and generally cause the body and nervous system to slow down and relax.
In 1910, the German hypnotist, Johan Schultz, taught patients to talk themselves into a relaxed state.
He had surprising results.
For instance when they repeated the phrase "my hands are warm" their hands did in fact grow warmer.
In 1964 American doctors confirmed Schultz experiments through instruments which monitored skin temperature.
The volunteer was asked to relax and to feel his hands getting warmer.
The instrument recorded an increase in temperature in their hands.
It involves more than just the absence of disease.
A truly healthy person does not only feet well but he gets along well with other people and has a realistic outlook on life.
Good health helps people to achieve their goals and enjoy life to the full.
If you know your mistakes and avoid committing them you will improve your health - you are a strong person.
People must , therefore,  have basic knowledge about the human body, how it functions, and its subtle defence mechanism.
Learning about good health should be made part of one's education so that from a tender age they come to know what will be good for their body and what will harm it.
To maintain physical health, all parts of the body must work together.
A person with a good physical and mental condition has the energy and the strength to enjoy active life and withstand the stress of daily living.
The essential conditions for good living are proper nutrition, exercise, rest, relaxation, sleep, cleanliness and medical and dental care.
A balanced diet provides all the food substance for health, proper growth and development.
Nutritionists classify nutrients into five main groups: carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins and minerals.
Water is essential for life but it is considered separately from nutrients.
A balance diet consists of a wide variety of foods.
Fruits and vegetables provide vitamins and minerals.
If you know your mistakes and carry on with them you will get unwell but will be able to come out of it by mending your mistakes.
Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products and nuts are rich sources of protein.
Bread, cereal and potatoes furnish carbohydrates in addition to vitamins and minerals.
Good nutrition includes eating the proper amount of food each day, overeating leads to obesity.
Excess weight puts extra strain on the heart and increases a person's chances of getting diabetes and other ailments.
The best way to lose weight is to follow a regular health farming programme of diet and treatment.
Exercise tones up muscles and improves the function of the circulatory and respiratory systems.
It enables the body to withstand stresses that otherwise could cause physical and emotional problems.
Rest and sleep help it to overcome fatigue and restore energy.
Cleanliness controls the growth of bacteria and germs.
A daily bath keeps the body free from dirt and odour.
You are an average person.
The hair should also be washed regularly.
Daily dental care, brushing the teeth properly and keeping them clean are essential for keeping good health.
The power of one's body to heal itself has not been fully realised.
Nature has worked out a defence mechanism for our body's ills.
Therefore health farming is not much different from farming in the fields.
With better nutrition, sun, fresh air, exercise and mental relaxation your health will bloom.
The body has an inherent capacity to heal itself.
The surgeon will put the broken ends of the bone together, keep them in position through a cast of plaster and after a few weeks the bones get united once again.
Gradually the wound gets healed, a new skin is formed and the crust falls out under its own weight.
When a foreign substance gets embedded in the body, say after an accident, it may be removed surgically but healing is done by nature.
If you make mistakes and if you do not know that you are making them, then you are incapable of avoiding them and you will become diseased and will not be able to come out of it - you are a weak person.
If a surgeon is not available, and the substance is not removed, the pain will increase, inflammation will set in around the foreign invader.
In medical terms, phagocytises set in, pus is formed and the foreign body is either digested or expelled along with the pus.
Nature like a mother is there to protect us when we fall ill, and improve our health if we are healthy.
We can compare health farming to farming in the field.
If we use good seeds, have proper fertilisation, moisture, sunshine and a right temperature the crop will bloom If any of these are missing, if the crop does not get proper moisture or proper temperature or the right sort of fertilizer the growth will be stunted.
If the missing factor is restored the crop again becomes healthy and green.
In farming, the quality of the seed is of prime importance.
A good quality seed will give a good produce.
If we give fertilizer, right moisture, sunshine and warmth to a bad quality seed the crop produced will not be as good as that of a good quality seed.
The same is true of the human body.
Health is man's birth right.
47. If we are lucky to have parents with good health, we will to a large extent inherit good health.
It is now realised that even smoking or alcohol or excessive tea or coffee can have adverse effect on the growing baby.
Physical health and mental health of the mother therefore influence the growth of the offspring.
Whether the child yet to be born will become a sanyasi, a hoodlum, a musician, a philosopher or a criminal will depend on the type of "seed" implanted in the mother.
In Mahabharata, there is a story of warrior Arjun, who related to his pregnant wife (carrying their first son Abhimanyu) about the complexities of army formations and how to tackle them.
He told her about how he got trapped in the enemy camp (chakravyuh) and how he and his soldiers managed to come out of it.
His wife being a worldly woman not keen on martial happenings, out of sheer boredom fell asleep while Arjun waxed eloquent about his prowess in the field of the battle.
Abhimanyu was born and he grew up to be a fine soldier.
He was caught in a situation similar to that of his father.
He was not able to come out of the enemy trap, and was caught in the confrontation and killed.
This story highlights that the mental state of a mother had definite influence on the growing child.
The body has the power to keep us free from the disease and still harbour the bacteria.
Only under great pressure people change their food habits for a while and then they return to their old ways.
If we have a high level of vitality we will be unaffected by a disease even when we come in contact with it.
When our resistance or vitality is low, these bacteria will multiply in number and attack us and then we might succumb to it.
We can take the level of vitality higher by a proper nutrition, restful sleep, exercise, drinking plenty of water, avoiding constipation and keeping ourselves relaxed.
Let us not forget the role of mental condition in the causation of disease.
It plays a major role in many diseases.
To kill the germ and cure the disease" is the doctrine of modern science.
If we see this doctrine in the light of above fact that you can harbour the germ and still may not suffer the disease, it really does not appeal to a sensible mind.
The body itself is keener to get rid of diseases and it has got the capacity.
It has a self defence mechanism.
Hindu scriptures advice that during pregnancy the mother should have a serene atmosphere is made to read good books and religious literature, to be made to listen to good music so that the right seed is implanted in the mind of the growing infant.
Our body has an inbuilt defence mechanism when faced with our enemy, the disease causing bacteria.
The first defence of the body is the outer skin and the membrane around the interior organs.
Both are mildly antiseptic liquids.
The stomach acids besides digesting food also kill many dangerous invaders that are often swallowed by us.
When the resistance of the body is low and the germs penetrate vulnerable areas, the body's infantry, the white blood cells of the blood, spring in action to its defence.
The average human body contains 3000 millions of them.
When germs invade, these cells rally and multiply at the sight of the infection and kill the enemy by absorbing and digesting it.
Thus the name Phagocytes (eating vessels) is given to these valiant fighters.
Many of the phagocytes die during the battle which rages in an infected area, say a boil.
Dead bodies of these cells get collected in the form of pus.
Music has good effect even on the growth of plants.
One day the boil bursts, all the pus comes out and the boil gets healed.
Antibodies are specific substances made in the blood in response to the antigen or toxins produced by invading bacteria.
They are specific substances made to fight the germs harbouring the body at the time of the disease.
This antibody is most effective in fighting the disease and the germs can never develop resistance to these antibodies because they are the instant produce of the body, as a result of the reaction of the toxins or antigen produced by bacteria.
They are very specific; they reach the seat of harbouring bacteria.
So that organs or parts of the body which are not diseased are not affected.
It will act at the site where it is required but at the same time it will act in a destructive way on other parts or organs of the body where it is not required.
All drugs apart from giving desired effects have harmful side effects also.
If a drug is used for a long time, the side effects can keep on mounting and harm the other organs of the body.
A simple pain killer can cause gastric ulcer, spoil digestion, affect even the heart, the kidney and the liver.
Scientifically, it has been found that music played daily to plants has helped to make them bloom better than those which do not have the benefit of music.
But in most cases the side effects are also slow to come.
They are not immediately known to the patient.
Sometimes they show up after a long interval and the patient is not able to connect the cause of the new disease to the bad effect of the drug taken earlier.
Any medical practitioner will agree that the best way to cure a disease is without drugs.
Here we may point out that even when the battle is won by phagocytes and antibodies, the body does not disband antibodies.
They persist in the blood stream for a long time, being reinforced occasionally by fresh ones manufactured in the liver and the lymphatic system So if the same germ should return, the correct antibodies are waiting to repel the attack.
When a child suffers from measles or small pox it gets immunity from the disease, second attack normally does not come.
It is the survival of the fittest, children in the slums are normally immune to several ailments that could otherwise kill children in well off families.
So do not panic when you get fever.
But do not let it rise very high - say above 104 *F.
This is true also of cows: they give more milk, if music is played to them.
You can use an ice cap and a cold sponge to bring it down.
Normally in 2-3 days through rest and fasting it will come to normal.
If you bring down fever by drugging you will hamper proper diagnosis.
Immunity is the self-defence mechanism by which the body protects itself from the invading germs and bacteria.
It includes B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, cells in the bone marrow, lymph nodes, peyers patches and thymus.
Protective immunity is critical for survival by the humans in the sea of potentially pathogenic microorganisms in which we live.
We may be able to indulge in drinking, smoking, eating the wrong type of food, be without exercise for some time and at the same time even can bear a lot of tension, but the body cannot tolerate injustice done to it if this goes on for a long time.
It has got its own adjustment and it tries to acclimatise the body to these wrongs to the best of its ability.
At a certain stage its adjustment fails.
The body can no more bear the torture done to it.
I feel that nutrition and exercises during pregnancy have to be given due weightage.
It starts breaking down and disease starts showing up.
There is a limit beyond which the body will not bear "the load", after that it says: 'I give up;".
It is then the foreign activists pounce upon it and begin their nefarious work.
There are two ways to keep our body healthy.
First avoid indulging in eating the wrong food.
Adhere to a proper diet, exercise every day, keep away from tension.
Listen to the cries of the body carefully, look out for the warning signs when you feel unwell or suffer from a disease, change the style of living to help the body recuperate.
Try to get rid of the disease by improving the health level.
Food and drinking habits should be in moderation, so that the harm done to the body is limited to enable you to come out of disease as soon as possible.
Many a time we do not listen to the body's cries and carry on with nefarious habits.
A pregnant working woman has often an easy and painless delivery while a high society mother may have a prolonged and painful delivery due to lack of exercise and over nutrition, and many a time they have to undergo a caesarean operation.
The way of high life to which we have been accustomed to is so dear that we avoid listening to the small cries of the body and its warning signs.
Disease goes on unabated and a time comes when it goes beyond reasonable help.
Not long ago, a principal of a medical college came to my clinic with his pain problems in the neck and in the shoulder joint.
Twenty four years back, he was my Professor of Surgery, now he was ailing.
In his more youthful days he was known for his discipline and courage.
A reputed surgeon, an excellent teacher, he was a chain smoker.
He liked to see his students always dressed properly and come in time for classes.
I was surprised to see him more so, when I found he had given up smoking.
I asked him what had happened.
I happened to get bronchitis.
We cannot deny the hereditary factor in certain diseases.
I consulted one of my colleagues who told me that the cause of bronchitis was smoking.
I could not give up smoking, so the bronchitis kept on getting worse.
I consulted him for the second time.
He advised me once again not to smoke.
I did not give up.
Six months later I went to him for the third time.
This time he was serious.
After a thorough examination, he cautioned me of the seriousness of my condition and added that if I continued smoking I would have about six months to live.
It was then that I decided to do away with smoking.
I did not smoke for 3 months.
If we take a swab of the throat of a healthy person and examine under the microscope we will find it riddle with bacteria of a number of diseases.
Later for 6months I carried a cigarette pack and a match box in my pocket.
To give up smoking is easy but to get out of the temptation of smoking is more difficult.
I then found that even if I had a cigarette and a match box I had no wish to smoke.
That day I realised that I had left cigarettes for good.
Unfortunately people keep on doing the same wrong thing in spite of the fact that they know that is not good for them.
If you have a sensitive body and strong mind, you may be able to change your ways of living to help the body to recuperate, to take it to a higher health level, so that you can once again, in a moderate way, indulge in your pursuit of pleasure.
But we often become prisoners of our own habits.
Our pleasure becomes superior to the needs of the body.
We become addicted to drinks, drugs, or cigarettes.
During my practice I have found that addiction to food is one of our biggest ailments.
They often remark that if they can't eat what they want, there is no point in living.
They have failed.
If you want to do light exercises like walking or playing golf you can do it just after a light meal of curd and salad or soup and toast or fruits.
Sooner or later there is a collapse and by the time you realise it, it may be late.
You may take refuge in holding Karma responsible - that you may have done bad things in the previous life and so God is punishing you now.
To enjoy good health you need not be a "Sadhu" (Saint) or a "Satwik" (eating all veg, non-fried food).
You must have the knowledge of your body, which will quickly react to the bad effects of harmful food habits.
Then ask yourself whether you take enough physical exercise and whether you are free from tension.
Read health books for basic guidelines on how to improve body health by natural means without taking recourse to tablets and medicines.
When your health is good, you are on the right track, you can enjoy life and have all the fun you want.
Only recently have the people become health conscious and gained knowledge that health is something within our own control.
So is the state of mind and heart and personal charisma.
They prefer a doctor who does not recommend a change of diet.
It is all within us.
People in general have paid little attention to this aspect.
Health and disease are governed by the laws of nature.
The responsibility for one's health lies within oneself.
People are now anxious to find ways and means to preserve health and restore it when it is lost.
They are keen to know how to care for their body.
They are beginning to realise that unlimited faith in potions and pills cause side effects.
Live in harmony with the laws of nature and be blessed.
Every violation of these laws will bring regret.
Such people suffer from inner tension.
They are prepared to pay fat medical bills to doctors and hospitals and swallow any number of pills and potions.
When you have good, sound health, you are vibrant.
You feel like doing things.
There is a feeling of achievement.
You look happy.
There is light in your eyes.
You feel clear in your mind.
The intensity of feeling makes you happy.
In higher temperatures, fatigue comes faster than in cold weather.
Low light tires us more easily.
A noisy atmosphere tires us faster.
But if they cannot listen to the warnings of the body and act accordingly this false support of pills and potions is not going to carry them long.
In an occupation where intellectual pursuits are involved, additional factors can affect a person.
If you like doing your job, you will feel less tired doing it.
If your domestic life is congenial, if you take more interest in the things around you, you will feel less tired.
An increased supply of oxygen leads to better muscle metabolism.
Glycogen depletion through the muscles is much less.
A person who is exercising should be particular about his diet.
He should take a high fat diet especially if he is young and growing.
This will increase the storage of glycogen in the muscles.
The muscles can work for a longer time.
The glycogen metabolism also slows down.
Ask any millionaire, whether he enjoys life.
This further reduces the speed of depletion of glycogen from the muscles.
A high carbohydrate diet is not suitable for such a person because the total glycogen depletion takes place much faster and so they feel tired more rapidly.
Many people believe that exercise should be done only in childhood.
For children, games are the best, because they are interesting and every child likes to play.
Children, who get involved in studies and neglect games, should be encouraged to play games.
If it is not possible then they should be coaxed to doing exercises.
If a child plays a game where only legs are exercised then it should be taught exercises to exercise upper parts of the body also.
When a person completes his studies he should start doing exercises to be fit throughout his life.
This can be supplemented by games or gymnastics whenever possible.
When a person approaches his fortieth birthday, he is at the peak of his productive period.
Ask a prematurely aged woman whether she enjoys her beauty.
He is too busy and comparatively richer.
He is too busy to exercise and he eats rich food.
At this age the bodily function starts slowing down.
Circulation of blood becomes sluggish.
There is a tendency to become obese and joints will start getting stiff.
At this age, exercise is most important.
It will slow down the ageing process.
He can play badminton or golf which is comparatively less strenuous.
But if you are going to start exercising after a long lay-off then you have to do it very slowly.
At the age of 60, this will depend more on the condition of your body.
Ask the pain racked philosopher whether he enjoys life.
A few can still do strenuous exercise if they have been regular.
For others a brisk walk to keep the circulation going is good enough.
Keep winding your body clock with the aid of exercises so that it will keep on running smoothly.
If you have frail health then goes slowly and do simple exercises.
In old age, the body is like a fatigued machine.
It is difficult to start it, but gradually it goes on working smoothly.
Exercises, during pregnancy, lactation and menstruation, should not be discontinued.
Exercise during pregnancy keeps the abdominal muscles firm and helps to have a painless and easy delivery.
They can be modified during the last few weeks of the pregnancy.
A few days rest will be necessary after delivery.
Ask the lonely old maid who rejected love and motherhood to have a career whether she enjoys her success.
Exercises done during lactation will keep the body in shape.
During menstruation, exercises can be continued.
If bleeding is profuse they can be modified.
You should exercise any time of the day, when you are free.
If you have a choice, the afternoon time is the best.
You can do them in the morning.
At this point of time, the joints are a little stiff and the heart slows down after the night's rest.
You may do a little warming up before you start doing a strenuous exercise.
There should not be any tiring of the body.
You will not be left with energy to do the day's work.
These people have ignored the life of the body.
It can also be done before retiring to bed.
It will refresh those who do mental work.
For those who exert physically during the day, it will be very refreshing, but do not forget to take your meal 2 hours before doing exercise.
Do not take a heavy dinner.
If the routine of your work allows time for exercising twice a day, do some exercises in the morning and additional little exercise in the evening.
Exercises should never be done before or after meals.
Vigorous exercises should be done at least half an hour before or two hours after the main meal.
When food is taken, the blood goes to the digestive organ and the nerve energy is diverted to it.
If exercises are done just after a meal, the blood and nerve energy will be diverted to the muscles and digestion will be impaired.
It is better to give the body one task at a time.
But if you feel uneasy even after such a sparse meal follow the rule of 'half an hour after meals'.
You may feel sore the next day after exercise.
The intercostals muscles get developed and the ribs are raised higher during inhalation.
This may happen when you are a beginner or over enthusiastic.
Take rest for a day and you will recover.
If you are weak or too tired avoid active exercise.
You can do passive exercise in the form of massage.
Avoid exercises, if you have a strain or a torn ligament.
Rest for a few days and you will come out of it.
A few stretching exercises are permitted to keep up the mobility.
Start with exercises which are easy to perform.
If you start with strenuous exercises to get quick results you will be disappointed.
You need not exercise 365 days of a year.
When you start exercising you will develop soreness, sprains or strain in your joints.
These are not permanent and they will pass off.
Do not over exercise, do not use all your surplus energy in exercise, it may be destructive.
Select the right exercises and do them properly and for a limited time.
You can increase the number of your exercises once a week.
Always be sure that exercises you do can be done easily.
Overdoing or under doing exercises is bad.
If you do not feel any increase in the strength or girth of your muscles steadily, probably you are under doing your exercises.
Test yourself and you will know how far you can go.
Start with 5 minutes of exercise, if you are a beginner.
Take a day off every week, but do not keep on increasing the off days.
The speed and the pause between exercises will determine what exercises are to be taken.
You will be surprised to find out how much you can do in five minutes.
You may increase your exercise time by two minutes every week; do not exceed 2 minutes.
The time is carefully chosen to keep you fit for physiological needs.
If you spend 20 minutes a day doing the below mentioned Asanas you can remain disease free.
The circulation of blood increases due to increased heart rate.
More oxygen is supplied to the blood due to increased respiration.
More blood, carrying more oxygen, reaches all parts of the body.
Thus all the organs receive more oxygen, more nutrition from the circulating blood, and more waste products, released by different organs of the body, are also carried away by this blood.
Thus through exercise the general health of the body starts improving.
Do not do extra exercise the next day, if you have missed a day of exercise.
During exercise, the muscles go on contracting and relaxing.
The muscles constitute almost half of the total body.
When they contract all the blood in them is expelled out.
When they expand all the blood gushes in.
The repetition of this process strengthens the muscles.
Thus the heart vigorously pumps out more blood and the pulsating blood vessels carry it to different parts of the body.
The blood reaches the most remote areas of the body also.
When this carbon dioxide reaches the lungs, it stimulates the lungs.
The rate and the depth of respiration increases.
This increase in respiration helps to increase the rate of exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the lungs.
If you have missed it for a week, do not think that it requires some rituals to start it again.
So the increased demand of the body for oxygen is met and more waste carbon dioxide produced by the more active body is eliminated through the lungs.
The lymph flow increases.
The lymph which is a carrier of digested food works for the elimination of the body's waste products.
All the organs of elimination like the skin, kidney, and bowels start functioning with a better capacity to cope with the extra amount of work load.
The skin becomes more active, the pores open up and more perspiration takes place.
This, apart from eliminating urea, works as a cooling tower.
The body which gets hotter by doing exercise is cooled down by perspiration.
The kidney gears itself up during exercise.
The demand for water increases.
Thus the kidney becomes more active during exercise.
A useful weapon can be misused, if you are over-enthusiastic.
The bowels are cleared more efficiently.
This happens due to the massaging effect on the small and the large bowels by the contracting abdominal wall.
Diaphragm does a similar job from the top.
The intestine has better peristaltic movements thus pushing the content of the bowels forward.
So all the four great channels of elimination - skin, kidney, lungs and bowels work more efficiently and clean the body from inside.
It is a better cleaning work than the one done from outside - taking a bath.
The digestion and assimilation of food improves due to exercise.
Increased circulation helps in a better distribution of digested food.
During exercise more nutrition is required.
Old cells break down and new cells form.
Do not exercise when you are ill.
So in a way body is renewing itself all the time.
For building up new muscles, material for building up cells is required.
The body demands more food.
The liver and the pancreas are massaged by the diaphragm.
The diaphragm is vigorously depressed and elevated by expanding and contracting the lungs.
The secretions of the liver and the pancreas increase and so more amount of digestive juices are available to digest the food.
Thus by exercising the appetite increases and food is digested and assimilated better.
The old muscle cells break during exercise.
They are eliminated, and new muscle cells are formed.
These new cells are larger and stronger.
Rest is the best cure during illness.
The new muscle cells produce less fatigue-poison called lactic acid.
These cells are efficient and put less load on the eliminative organs of the body.
The connective tissue tendons which connect muscles to bones get renewed.
They help in improved muscle action.
Stronger bones and flexible joints help in the smooth functioning of joints.
The heart benefits out of exercise.
As the contraction and relaxation of the heart muscles is vigorous during exercise, these muscles are exercised and become stronger.
The heart keeps on beating from birth to death.
It does an enormous amount of work.
The work done by the heart of a young man of twenty-five in twenty-four hours is enough to lift six tons of weight to the height of one foot.
Stop there and then if you feel pain during or after exercises or if you have inflammation of certain joints.
The heart does this job without tiring itself out.
The beats are controlled by nerves which are not controlled consciously.
There are yogis who can control their heart system through concentration.
They can reduce their heart rate at will and even stop it for a few moments.
The lungs receive more blood from the exercised heart.
As more blood comes to the lungs, the lungs has to purify it faster and return it to the heart.
For this purpose the breath comes faster and deeper.
The lungs get adjusted to exercises.
The chest expansion becomes greater and new lung cells are formed.
Lungs become bigger, more elastic so the capacity of the lung to take in more air improves.
Thus the capacity of the lungs increases.
Carbon dioxide from the blood gets eliminated in to the air while we breathe out.
If in use, you will keep it flexible.
This increase in breath is called "second wind".
Even after we stop doing exercises, the heart continues to beat faster and we still keep on breathing heavily till the three worst toxins are eliminated.
This is known as acute fatigue and is quite uncomfortable for the body.
The general fatigue will pass off in a few hours or after a night's sleep.
Your capacity and skills increase.
The level of training can be gauged by measuring the oxygen consumed and the accumulated lactic acid.
A simple method has been devised.
An efficient circulation of blood in a trained person is characterised by a slow rise in the pulse rate during exercise and a prompt return to the resting condition after exercise.
The pulse rate during severe exercise goes up to 140/mt.
This can be noted by measuring the chest after breathing in and out.
In five minutes after stopping the exercises, it should come to normal.
The pulse rate is also affected by emotion.
This is a very simple test and can be used easily by any person.
The test of physical fitness is a sure pointer to cardiovascular fitness.
Among older people, the effect of training can likewise be demonstrated.
A tense relationship can tire you faster.
Agility, endurance, flexibility and strength are the test of fitness.
A combination of qualities that enables a person to perform well in vigorous physical activities leads to physical fitness.
Healthy people may be physically unfit because they do not exercise regularly.
Good health and physical fitness are the same.
After doing exercises the girth of the chest gradually increases following inspiration (breathing in).
Individuals who are physically fit tend to be more slender and develop greater resistance to disease and recover faster if they do become ill.
They are more alert and relaxed.
Physical fitness is a personal responsibility.
Most people are physically unfit because they simply do not get sufficient exercise.
The years between adolescence and middle age are the peak period for physical fitness.
Habits that aid physical fitness include getting enough sleep, eating properly, receiving regular medical and dental care, and maintaining personal cleanliness.
Health can be harmed by overeating or eating the wrong kinds of food; smoking; drug abuse and excessive alcohol.
Fitness during childhood influences fitness in an adult.
Nobody seems to give a thought to his/her health.
Push yourself, discipline yourself to do exercises every day for just one month and then you will get into the habit.
We have a good check fatigue to guide us.
It must become a second nature to you.
Then all the doors of happiness will open, you will live and enjoy every moment of it.
The history of exercise goes back to thousands of years.
An ancient book called "Mallayudha" mentions the scope of exercise and refers to the cure by manipulation if something goes wrong while doing strenuous exercises.
Believes of the Indian system of exercise like wrestling, Dand Baithak, Mugdar etc find courage from Hanuman and they pray to him for strength.
Cong Fou of ancient China was a series of ritualistic postures and motions prescribed by priests for relief of pain and other symptoms of ailments.
Ancient Greeks had their God of Health ("Aesculapius").
There were in fact temples of health.
The entire nation including their Kings, used to worship at these temples and keep their bodies fit, trim and beautiful.
Hippocrates, the father of modern medicine, said "the wasting of the fleshy parts" is the greatest in those cases in which the patient keeps the limb up and does not exercise it.
It works as a safety valve, as a limit to exercise.
Those who practice walking have least atrophy.
Frequent and rapid walks were recommended by him to reduce obesity.
He ordered a cautious approach when resuming strenuous exercises after prolonged rest.
Primitive people practiced it.
In modern times we have come back to the idea of early ambulating and postpartum exercises to strengthen the abdominal wall.
Russian author, SP Bodkin, advocated breathing exercises for those who have suffered a heart attack so that they will not feel short of breath on slight exertion.
Facilitation has been instituted as an adjutant to strengthen weakened muscles particularly in hemiplegics.
They are useful for regaining control of voluntary muscles.
People know how you look, and you know how you feel.
By exercising, your appearance will improve, your sagging abdomen will sink in and your muscles will bulge.
We should gauge the amount of exercise that we should do, for better results.
Your personality and gait will improve.
There will be lightness in your step.
You will feel like a new, youthful person.
A person has a pulse rate of 72 beats per minute.
If you take a short run or do vigorous exercise you will feel short of breath, and may not be able to run longer.
The pulse at this stage may reach 140/mt.
If you exercise regularly the pulse rate will gradually come down.
In a week, a month, 3 months, one year you will note a marked reduction of pulse rate at rest.
If you take a run or do vigorous exercises you will be able to run a longer distance or do exercise for a longer time before becoming breathless.
This means that now you are capable of putting in more hours of work without getting tired.
Beyond that we begin to feel fatigue.
You will not feel fagged out or exhausted at the end of the day.
Still a lot of energy will be in reserve for you to enjoy life, since you have become more vibrant, energetic and ready to suck the honey of life.
Most heart attacks and strokes come during the period of emotional stress.
This may coincide with a set back in business or even while watching a tense world cup.
During stress, a hormone, called adrenalin, is secreted into the blood.
Due to it, the pulse rate rises, blood pressure shoots up, blood becomes more viscous and blood sugar rises.
If you have been exercising regularly, you can cope up with all these stress signals.
Exercising the heart can help you to cope up with emergencies much better.
The coronary artery of the heart muscles has many branches which are linked profusely by capillaries.
During an emergency as the pulse rises, more blood is pumped, all the capillaries open up and so there is no chance that the heart will have a lesser oxygen supply leading to its failure.
When we run or do exercise the breath becomes deeper.
The capillaries open up and the blood pressure will not shoot up high.
When you exercise the sugar in the blood is burnt up and you are equipped better to cope up with such an emergency.
Even if the coronary artery of such a person is blocked by floating fat, the heart will not be affected by lack of oxygen.
This is possible because of a profuse branching out of coronary arteries and plenty of blood supply through the capillaries in the heart wall.
Enough supply of oxygen will be maintained and the heart will not be infracted.
When you fill up the petrol tank of a car, it overflows when full.
If you eat 2,800 calories every day and use only 2,400 calories in routine work, 400 calories left will be stored.
When you keep on storing what is left out, the unused energy, you start gaining weight.
When you exercise, the fat is converted into muscles, muscles are heavier than fat, so by exercises you may gain weight instead of losing it.
But you will feel better and look better.
There is frequent bringing in of more oxygen into the lungs that gets absorbed into the blood.
The best way to reduce weight is to combine exercise with low calorie diet.
A human being has many noiseless, flexible and strong joints.
They carry the entire weight of the body from place to place, tirelessly.
A series of small joints in the spine is the most important of them all.
Due to their flexibility one can bend, twist or turn and still keep the strength and control over them.
These joints become stiffer as you advance in age.
You can remain young as long as you can keep your joints flexible with the help of exercise.
Yoga exercises (Asana) are the best for the mobility of the spine.
Yoga strengthens the nervous system.
The spine is like the battery of your body.
It makes you feel young and keeps all other functions of the body in a firm condition.
Exercises done in a reclining position need more exertion than while standing.
This way they can stop or slow down the oncoming deformity, can have more movement and the pain will be much less.
You can choose a special apparatus to exercise if you require support.
If you are keen on muscles, lay stress on muscles, then keep on increasing the resistance.
Bending up to a certain point is easy, beyond this point you feel tension in your muscles and if you still go further you will feel pain.
If you keep on doing exercises the mobility of the joints goes on increasing.
The point of pain becomes the point of tension in a few days and gradually you can still go beyond this point without pain.
This principle has been used in exercising the patients with stiff joints.
Movement and pain are indirectly related.
With the help of exercises, as he increases his movements, the pain goes on decreasing, ultimately he becomes pain free.
If the movement is made up to the point of pain, the muscles become tense in protective response and desired result will not be achieved.
Learning Asana with the help of a book sometimes can be dangerous.
Do not exercise in a haphazard and careless manner.
Exercises should be done carefully, gracefully and at the right speed.
When you do exercises, do them with all concentration.
At every moment your mind should know what your body is doing.
You should not do exercises as a punishment.
You may do exercises along with music or select the right exercise for a particular time.
Combine your exercises with breathing.
It will enhance their good effect, So do them when you are relaxed.
Even a slight tension causes wasting of nerve energy.
Exercises should not be completed at a single go.
You are benefited by Asanas only when the "asan" or your sitting posture is correct while doing it.
After each exercise, relax for a while.
This will help your exercising muscles fill up with blood.
It will help the lungs to catch up and clear all fatigue poison from the blood.
Alternate your exercise with games, boating or swimming to keep the interest alive.
You can alternate exercise with yoga asana.
Do exercise for one day and yoga asana the next.
Yoga asanas make the body healthy and the nerves strong.
If exercises are important, so is rest.
After rest, you will feel energetic and this energy should be utilised for doing exercises.
If you do not utilise it either it is wasted or the body stops generating it.
This is why it is always safer to learn Asanas from a good teacher.
During rest, the body eliminates waste materials, builds new cells and repairs the old ones.
When you feel tired you must rest.
If you have done the right amount of exercises you will become fresh after a restful sleep.
The requirement of sleep differs for different people.
Many can do with six hours; others may need 8 to 10 hours.
If you know to relax well, relax before your sleep, your requirement of sleep will be reduced.
A strong and well built body is a great asset in life.
It helps to face adverse situations and to achieve greater heights in your professional career and in day to day activities.
A well worked-out system of routine activities with an intelligent diet can lead you to higher attainments and help overcome mental and emotional difficulties and bring happiness from within.
Better health and great physical power can be acquired by exercises and adherence to certain rules.
I do not recommend shrishasana (Head stand).
It does not come naturally as you grow to maturity.
Food we eat is important.
Food provides energy for daily work, helps in growth and provides vitamins and minerals which help us maintain good health.
Breathing is one of the most important factors required for building up the body.
We can live without food for days, without water for a few days, but we cannot do without air even for five minutes.
Pure air is an important factor for body building.
Open the windows in your bed rooms.
Be sure there is fresh supply of air day and night.
More and more people are regulating the temperature, humidity and ventilation of the room through air conditioners.
At least, it helps in proper ventilation.
People who can benefit from Shirshasana are only those who have good health.
We know that 50% of the body is made up of muscles.
Proper exercise must be taken for their proper growth and development.
When a man exercises his body, he becomes muscular and when a woman exercises her body, it helps to become round and curvaceous.
Nature has made the woman's body in such a way that muscles do not grow in the same way as man's muscles do.
Many people think that better health comes from something unknown.
It is clear that now superior health can be achieved by anybody who is prepared to make an effort and a small sacrifice.
Many people seem to have more body energy and prolonged youth.
This comes when they are lucky to have inherited it from their parents.
They seem to abuse and misuse their body and still keep themselves healthy.
They are, in fact, spending the vitality from their forefathers.
The weak will benefit the same by doing sarvang asana (Shoulder stand).
But their progeny may have to pay the penalty.
If we study the lives of people who had a long existence, the secret of their longevity is found in their diet and daily exercises.
Women grow old much faster than men, because, men keep themselves more active.
When you exercise you have a strong heart, strong stomach and so your brain also gets better nourishment.
You choose an exercise and do it regularly, but, remember, it takes years to build a beautiful body.
Everyone does not have a gymnasium in their vicinity.
Still, if one cannot afford to go to a gym, the best alternative is to take a walk, a brisk walk or go jogging.
This can be regulated according to one's age and strength.
If you are sad or depressed, walk and walk deliberately and you will come out of your depression.
If you have a problem or an emotional strain, get out of the house and go for a walk and you will be able to solve it.
The rate of exercise can be decreased or increased.
Walk and you will have time to think.
Understand your problem and plan your strategy to make life better.
Walking is an interesting activity.
You will make many new friends and it will give you a feeling of sharing human activities.
It is good for old and middle aged people.
Youngsters should do more strenuous exercises or jog vigorously.
They should participate in games.
Exercises for women are more important than for men.
They gain strength and beauty.
If they are strong, they impart strength to their children.
If you feel you have not done enough exercise you can increase the speed till you feel exhausted.
If they are weak their children will be weak.
Failing marriages can be traced to weaknesses in the body and low vitality.
Failures in marriages will be less if the woman is more alive, more supple and bubbling with health.
Swimming is a good exercise.
In swimming every part of the body is exercised as you are free to move in all directions, like a bird in the air.
The deformity in Ankylosing Spondylitis generally occurs due to bad postures during sitting and lying.
Gradually the curvature and the restriction of movements of these patients go on increasing.
They should try to sleep on a hard bed with a thin pillow.
They should try to sleep on the back and in front without any support for a few minutes.
They should always sit on a straight back chair and should keep on exercising even if they have some bearable pain.
These joints can quickly get stiffened and can lose mobility.
Gradually, by the exercise of the joints, mobility will increase.
Only one thin pillow should be given in the night.
A patient must exercise on his own and can do a few exercises assisted by his therapist.
He can walk with the help of a walker or assisted by somebody.
He can walk with crutches.
Use elbow crutches rather than axillary crutches to avoid crutch palsy.
After crutches the patient can walk with the help of a cane.
Gradually the patient starts building up his muscle control.
All this will depend upon age, the patient's endeavour and how determined he is to come out of it quickly.
Exercises are important at the chronic stage, otherwise deformity is certain.
If the joints are not exercised properly, they become fixed in flexed position, muscles become thin and wasted and inflammatory products get deposited around the joints.
Even from the onset of the disease when the pain is acute, a gentle local joint movement should be started for a short period, once or twice a day.
Many other deformities occur in rheumatoid arthritis.
If the patient has been sleeping on a soft bed, the cervical spine flexes till the chin reaches near the chest.
The patient looks as if he is curled up in a ball.
The bones become osteoporotic and more often get fractured by little training.
These patients need a well planned and supervised exercise therapy.
Gradually their movement and muscle power will increase.
Some heat therapy to the joints before exercise may be given.
This helps to relax the muscles and increases the blood supply and so the exercise becomes more effective.
The joint stiffness and contraction improves slowly and needs a lot of patience and perseverance on the part of both the physician and the patient.
The first exercise for the affected joint should be taught by the therapist in a long session.
The patient should be encouraged to do exercises himself, or with joints supported by the therapist.
Exercise should be supervised at least twice a week by the therapist and the improvement noted.
Exercise pools are of great help, where the patient can move his joints freely in all directions.
General exercise should also be given along with specific joint exercises.
Resistance exercises should be given to increase the power of the muscles which support the body in movement and during work.
If your weight is 70kg, in water your legs have to support only 7kg.
Due to weak legs as in paraplesia or due to painful knees as in arthritis, if you cannot stand, probably you will be able to balance, water will help you to do so.
Water relaxes spastic muscles so you can do exercises in water more easily.
Water relieves tension and is of great help for tense patients.
If pool water is at 37 degrees centigrade it will relax you better and relieve aches and pains.
Move the legs alternatively keeping the knees straight.
An increase of pain after exercises indicates an excessive amount of motion.
The patient, after walking for a few minutes, gets acute pain in the calf muscles and is relieved by rest for a few minutes.
This is due to the narrowing of blood vessels.
The blood supply has to increase during walking.
Blood demand increases when the patient walks and if, due to narrowing of the blood vessels, the supply of blood does not increase an ischemic condition is reached.
These patients should stop smoking, as cigarette smoking is known to have detrimental effect in such patients.
They are instructed to take a brisk walk of one hour every day.
They are allowed to rest for a few minutes when the pain recurs and then resume the brisk walk.
Patients with arterio sclerotic obliterance symptoms who are confined to bed or chair must exercise through progressive restrictive movements performed with the help of a therapist or a member of the family.
Age is no bar for doing exercise.
A 67 year old man with intermittent claudicating could walk only 5 blocks.
The muscles around the affected joint should be voluntarily contracted and relaxed by the patient by moving the joint, called static exercise, done 2-3 minutes every hour.
They should walk 1/2 to 1km initially and increase the distance gradually as health permits.
This can be combined with simple free hand exercises or exercises with steps, cycle with a meter or a tread mill.
They should preferably walk instead of moving in a car if the distance is short.
With this improvement, they will experience a drop in the heart rate during exercise.
Even those who have the severe form of the disease can increase their exercise levels and oxygen intake by twenty percent.
Breathing exercises are a great help in 'retraining' in breathing.
We use the same exercises for asthma, bronchitis and emphysema.
We have tried to include all the good points from many of these exercises.
Patients should have confidence in the therapist.
They should be taught individually and later they may join a group.
As the patient's condition improves, exercises must be increased, but not too rapidly, otherwise a relapse may occur.
When he does these exercises in a group, he will be encouraged by others and will feel more confident and will put in better effort.
It is most important for a patient with asthma and emphysema to relax.
These patients are always tense, nervous and exhausted because all the time they are making a continuous effort to avoid suffocation.
If you watch these patients carefully you will find many signs of tension.
They may have tremors in the hands, their eyes may twitch when closed, and they may have a short movement pattern in their chest region as they are all the while conscious of their breathing.
They may show more movement in the upper chest, shoulders, neck and spine, especially when they are seen.
This tension and these wasteful movements unfortunately use up a lot of energy.
If they are relaxed, only then can they learn to breathe more efficiently and in the right sort of way.
A patient should be told about these wasteful movements and also be taught the intricacies of abdominal breathing.
He should be told that proper breathing will be less taxing and will reduce the attacks of breathlessness.
Now gradually exercises should be increased but overindulgence may cause a relapse.
These new methods are not short term methods, and should be used permanently.
At the time of an attack he should give more attention to these new methods and he will be benefited by the new knowledge.
These patients should be provided with a happy and congenial atmosphere at home.
They should also adopt a happy-go-lucky attitude.
When the patient is taught to have relaxation, an atmosphere of silence must prevail.
He should be made to lie down comfortably with his head and knees supported by a pillow and the arm resting comfortably.
He should be told about the difference between tense and relaxed muscles.
This should continue till he knows how to relax them completely.
This should be done in the muscles of the arm, shoulder, neck, face, chest and abdomen.
These tensions in the muscles can be measured, and we shall know about their success.
The patient can reduce his period of rest.
When the patient has learnt this relaxation, he is ready for exercises.
He starts with stretching and relaxing the short muscles of the shoulder and the upper chest.
Various rhythmic and swinging exercises designed for the purpose are carried out along with respiration.
Do the breathing exercises in the morning or in the evening when the stomach is empty.
Standing position gives the advantage of freedom for muscle movements.
Stand erect, arms at your sides, exhale slowly and deeply, bend your neck, bring your shoulders forward and contract the abdomen.
You will find that you can further exhale more air.
Now start breathing in slowly, expand the chest, abdomen and straighten the neck.
To inhale a little more, lift your chest further, retract the abdomen a little and extend the neck.
Hold the breath for a few moments and start breathing out slowly and reverse the movement of the arms and heels.
The splint can be removed for longer periods or kept only during the night.
Hold the breath for a few moments and start it again.
When the arches of the feet are flattened, the patient feels pain while walking.
The knees also point sideways, that means that the entire leg has rotated at the hip joint.
Most of the deformities are produced during the first four months, when the child is too young to turn over.
In whatever position the child is placed, just after birth, it knows its position of comfort.
Stretched muscles become weak and contracted muscles become powerful.
An acute stage is reached when the pain is acute and the joint inflamed.
These patients should be treated with confidence, the message will reach automatically to the patient and they will know that they are in the right hands.
A wooden bench with a thin cotton mattress on it should be good enough.
The foot can be placed against a padded board to prevent foot-drops.
The arms should be held close to the body and with the elbow flexed.
Start by keeping the hands on the waist, feet together, body erect.
Your body is a more sophisticated machine than a car and it deserves better care.
Bend at the knees and the hips, lowering the body until calf and thigh form an angle of about 110 degrees.
Now jump as high as 15-20 centimetres and land on straight legs.
This combination will break your monotony and will be more effective.
Tense the muscles of your abdomen, hold it for 6 seconds and hold your breath.
Constitutional type strengthens vital organs and increases their activity.
They are not strenuous.
They can be done by people of all ages and of all occupations.
Isometric exercises exert muscle force but no movement takes place.
The position of the arms should be changed frequently.
They evoke an increase in the blood pressure and smaller increase in the heart rate during exercises of hand grip, climbing steps, resistance wheel, rowing machine etc.
They are more useful for cardiac patients.
They produce cardio vascular distress which is physiological and rapidly reversible.
The blood pushed out with every heart beat called stroke volume increases 4-5 times in a normal person when he progresses from rest to vigorous exercise.
The oxygen consumption increases 10-12 times in a normal human being during vigorous exercise.
The heart muscles will become ischemic as external physical load increases during exercises.
In both cases the medical management is almost the same.
Of course, in myocardial infarction initially 8-12 weeks of complete rest is given so that infarction may heal up, and activity is started gradually.
Regular physical exercises will prevent further progression of coronary Atherosclerosis (narrowing due to fat deposit in the coronary wall).
It has been found that the incidence of heart diseases is much lower among bus conductors than the less active bus drivers.
The swelling decreases and the patient gets relief from pain much faster.
The first step in the conditioning programme for heart patients is to do an exercise test.
It will determine the intensity and duration of the prescribed exercise.
The usual procedure is for the patient to maintain the highest conditioning heart rate at 80-85% of the measured maximum of symptomatic heart rate.
At least five or six mechanical devices like stair steps, bicycle, rowing machine, and resistance for four minutes should be available for the tests, at the end of which the heart rate should be taken as the target heart rate level.
Then each of the group rotates to other stations or devices.
Over exercising can cause harm.
For chest or Pulmonary diseases, value of breathing and general exercises, as an adjunct particularly in treating of Asthma, Bronchitis, Emphysema, etc has been recognized.
Patients are consistent and generous in their praise for the relief provided.
Physicians with long experience put their faith in stressing the benefit provided by these exercises.
Before we make an attempt to do the exercises, we should be made aware of the elastic property of the lungs and the thoracic wall (chest wall).
Lie on the floor face down, hands under shoulders, palms flat on the floor.
The lungs resist change in their shape because of their elastic property.
In the normal state the inclination of the lungs to empty is opposed by the inclination of the thoracic wall to fill.
A stiffer lung will empty a smaller volume and the rigid chest wall will hold the lung at bigger volumes.
The lung volume established passively by the elastic properties is the functional residual volume of the lung, normally varying around 3000ml.
It is important to note that this is the volume to which the lung will return passively.
A change of lung volume away from functional residual volume requires active muscular effort.
The contraction of the diaphragm decreases thoracic pressure and thus increases the lung volume, simultaneously by compressing the abdomen it increases abdominal pressure.
The action of the diaphragm is to produce inspiration which means drawing breath.
It is also active while vomiting and in defecation.
The external intercostals muscles help in inspiration.
Straighten the arms, lift the body and raise the hip to the highest point.
The internal intercostals muscles help in expiration.
In the quiet tidal breathing, the diaphragm moves approximately 1.5 cm in the standing position and little more in the supine position.
The rib cage increases 1 cm while standing and 6cm in supine posture.
Anteroposterior displacement is greater than lateral displacement.
While breathing to the maximum volume (deep breath) the rib circumference increases by 8cm, the anteroposterior diameter by 3cm, and lateral diameter by 1.5cm.
The maximum diaphragmatic expansion is 10cm.
The linear displacement of diaphragm accounts for approximately two third of changes in the lung volume.
Two forces oppose the changes in the lung volume.
The first one is the elastic property which determines the dispensability of lung and thorax.
The second one is the resistance of the airways developed in common pulmonary diseases due to bronchial muscle constriction, with muscle Congestion and Hyper secretion.
Then the head travels slowly down in the direction of the arms and after the nose has reached the floor level, the chin and the chest are brought to the same level.
In the presence of bronchial disease, the increased resistance of distal airways lowers the pressure in proximal airways, so they are more easily compressed.
Thus an increased airway resistance, even closure, is readily produced by overactive expiratory efforts.
Less forceful expiration may force more air.
The oxygen consumption of respiratory muscles increases over ten times in respiratory diseases due to extra force put in by the muscle.
Any exercise which attempts to produce higher minute volume are jeopardised.
This is because the extra oxygen (O2) absorbed might, at least theoretically, be consumed by expiratory muscles in their increased effort.
Tissue destruction reduces the elastic property of the lung tissue.
The tendency of the chest wall to distend leads to hyper-ventilation of the lungs.
The mechanical or microbial threat to airways are dealt with in part by the secretion of the muscle and by cough reflex mediated by Vague nerve.
A simple lung function test may be prescribed.
Take a deep breath in, at the starting position and breathe out slowly during the movement.
The lung function test enables the physician to know whether there is an obstruction to the air flow, but not whether the patient has lung cancer.
Vital Capacity is the amount of air expelled by maximum voluntary effort.
In a normal person about 3/4 of air in the lungs is expelled in the first second and within 3 seconds all of it is expelled out.
In a diseased lung there may be obstruction in the air passage.
Therefore, the amount of air expelled in the first second will be much less.
If the air expelled in one second is as much as 70% of the tidal volume, the lung under scrutiny will be normal.
If it is less than this, it will be due to obstruction in the airway passage.
This test should be repeated after a few weeks to measure if there is noticeable improvement.
The maximum expiratory flow can be measured by a peak flow meter.
This portable instrument directly measures the peak flow rate which is otherwise reduced when there is obstruction of the airways.
This is a difficult exercise and to make it easy the hands can be placed on a higher level than that of the feet.
In asthma as the lungs usually remain quite normal, few patients ultimately develop emphysema.
In bronchitis there is hypertrophy of mucous glands in the trachea and bronchi with high proportion of goblet cell which produces excessive mucus that obstructs the passage.
In bronchial diseases there may be obstruction with or without infection leading to more severe consequences or abscess formation.
The sufferers of asthma and bronchitis should be given a simple programme of exercise.
By exercising the breasts, they can be made firm, bigger and round.
A beautiful woman creates the impression of beauty by her physique, good posture, brightness in her eyes, fresh skin colour and the way she carries her body.
In modern life, man thinks he is working hard.
Yes he does so but often without involving much physical activity.
All kinds of modern conveniences make for a less energetic existence.
In fact, new gadgets and conveniences have brought about a sudden change in man's habits.
This is a good exercise to strengthen your arms, chest and back.
Man was used to cutting wood, carry water and live under primitive conditions.
Physical labour was involved in every step.
A body used to hard work will not enjoy doing sedentary work all of a sudden.
Sedentary habits put an unnatural pressure on the body.
It is then that we are prone to nervous breakdown, insomnia, headaches and nervous ailments.
Exercises are as important as eating and sleeping.
Businessmen who have taken to walking or golf are finding a wonderful release for their tension.
If you do not have the time to take care of your most valuable possession - your body - then you will have plenty of time for getting strapped to the sick bed and for planning slowly for your funeral.
If you look after the body well you will be more ambitious, determined and energetic.
A car needs an oil change, a regular supply of petrol and water and regular tuning.
Raise the head, breathe in deeply and breathe out slowly as you go down.
Breathe out as you come down.
If you want to get real benefit from bread you must eat all of the three components in the same proportion as God has provided it.
Hold your breath while coming back to the starting position.
Raise the left knee as high as possible, holding the leg with the hands, just below the knee and the shin.
Hold your breath while coming to the starting position.
Repeat the exercise with the right knee.
It will help you strengthen the abdominal and the thigh muscles.
Arms circled, Stand erect, feet about thirty centimetres apart.
Swing both arms in a circular motion, clockwise.
Breathe slowly and deeply throughout.
This exercise will help you to shape your arm muscles and to lift your breasts.
Touch the floor outside the left foot, come up a little and down again to touch the floor between the feet, and touch between the feet once more.
You can do the same exercise more effectively by not raising your heels.
Lie back on a hard surface.
Raise both the legs together without bending the knees as far as you can, and slowly try to achieve the right angle position, lowering and raising the legs slowly.
Breathe in while at the relaxed lying position, breathe out while lifting the legs, and hold your breath while lowering the legs.
Keep your back as straight as possible and move to a sitting position.
Slide your hands along the legs during this movement, and finally touch the toes.
Breathe in while lying down and breathe out while coming up and touching the toes.
Do not push yourself too hard while moving to touch the toes.
Keep the feet on the floor, in the beginning if necessary hook them under a chair.
Lie on your side, leg straight, lower arm stretched over the head along the floor, top arm used for balancing.
Come up and touch outside the right foot.
Raise the upper leg as far as possible.
Gradually your leg will reach a perpendicular position to the floor.
Breathe out while raising the leg, hold your breath while bringing your leg down.
This is a good exercise to reduce hips and thighs.
Lie on your back, legs straight and together, arms stretched sideways at shoulder level.
Raise the left leg to a perpendicular position, drop it across the body and try to touch the left toes with the right hand, raise the leg to a perpendicular position and return to the starting position.
Keep the body and legs straight throughout and shoulders touching the floor.
Breathe in while lying down and breathe out during raising the legs and taking it across.
Hold your breath till you come to the starting position.
Breathe out slowly as you raise your chest and legs up, hold your breath as you bring them down.
If you cannot touch the floor, just move in that direction.
Excess sugar puts extra load on the pancreas to secrete more insulin and when it can't do so we get diabetes.
Sugar raises cholesterol level in the blood which is the main cause for high blood pressure and other diseases.
It is easier to give up sugar than smoking and alcohol.
Recent studies in the U.S.S.R, in the Institute of Preventive Cardiology, have connected refined sugar to serious problems like gout and arthritis.
Sugar raises the level of uric acid in blood.
Eat poor man's food and avoid rich man's disease.
Dr Higginson claimed that a large group of cancer common in North America, Europe and Japan had been linked to general diet.
He said it was suspected that cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum and breast, relatively rare in most parts of Africa and India, were connected with the amount of fat in the diet.
A comprehensive study made by the National Cancer Institute, U.S.A. (NCI) estimated that 35% of all cancers, particularly in the United States, can be associated with dietary influences.
The main factor increasing colon cancer risk was too much dietary fat and too little dietary fibre.
Hold your breath when you come up to the starting position.
Most Americans get 40 percent of their total calories intake from fat.
The level generally recommended for prevention of cancer and heart diseases is 30% or less of calories from fat.
Fibre in diet increases the bulk of stool and speech of transit.
Transit time is the length of time food takes to pass through the body.
In western diet it may take 48 to 72 hours.
Officers in British navy and their wives had stools which ranged in weight from 38 to 223gm (two table spoon to a cup in volume).
British vegetarians who like vegetarians from Uganda and India have stool weighting from 178 to 980 gms, the average being four times that of naval officers.
Bulky stool dilute carcinogens present in stool and rapid transit reduces the time of action for the carcinogens on the gut wall.
Thus fibre in diet helps us in the prevention of cancer.
Exposure of meat to high temperature as in charcoal and microwave oven help in the formation of a compound with more carcinogenic risk.
This exercise will strengthen your back and abdominal muscles.
Increased use of Vitamin C may account in part for the decrease in the incidence of gastric carcinoma observed in recent years.
Large amount of nitrates in certain vegetables, over fertilized, are carcinogenic to some extent.
Better to fertilize the fields with organic matter and use minimum insecticides to prevent this problem.
Aflatoxin is found in peanuts and grains stored under moist conditions.
There is a lot of faddism regarding diet.
Big industries promoting different food products claim them to be holistic and will give you energy and vitality, make you more attractive and reverse the process of disease.
They invent every day indigenous methods to defraud the masses.
The food industry is more concerned with gratifying the taste buds and making profits than looking after their customer's health.
Fast food joints are opening up in major towns in India.
They provide pizzas, hamburger, ice creams and milk shakes.
Stand erect, feet about thirty centimetres apart, left arm extended over head, bent at the elbow.
These are high calorie foods loaded with lots of fat and sugar and lacking in fibres.
Cabbage and cauliflower have a chemical in them called indole which acts against cancer in the bowels.
It protects us against many diseases - from constipation to heart diseases and cancer.
The other type is found in indigestible cellulose - the roughage of fruits and vegetables.
Fruits and their skin, potatoes, green leaves, spinach, cabbage and cauliflower are important for our diet.
The fibre from cereals is an inferior fibre source.
The fibre in fruits, vegetables and pulses are softer and superior.
Wheat fibre has no effect on the cholesterol level.
The viscous type fibre present in fruits and vegetables in large doses produce a major reduction in cholesterol.
Artificial sweeteners, saccharin and cyclamates, are associated with the cancer of the bladder.
Keeping the back straight bend sideways to the right and slide your right hand along the right leg as far as possible and at the same time press to the right with left hand.
Cooking practices like too much frying or too much browning of onions and masala may release hydrocarbons or other carcinogens in food although no epidemiological observations are available.
Colon and rectal cancer is more common in developed countries.
Its incidence is high in North America, New Zealand, Europe and low in South America, Africa and Asia.
The United State has the highest rate of colonic cancer in the world.
There is a higher risk among the city folk than the rural population.
Diet is an important factor.
There is low incidence of appendicitis, adenoids (tonsilitis), diverticulosis, ulcerative collitis, and colorectal cancer in South Africa, Bantu area, where the diet contains more fibre and less animal fat.
There is a direct association between fat and animal protein intake in the western diet and the rising incidence of colonic cancer.
In Japan, the intake of fat (mostly unsaturated) provides only 12% of total calorie intake.
In the United States the fat intake represents 40-44% of the total calories intake.
Come up a few centimetres and press to the right again.
The consumption of barbecued meat, smoked pickled fish and alcohol and deficiency of magnesium and Vitamin A are related to gastric cancer.
Milk stimulates acid secretion.
Taking milk between meals and bed time is not healthy.
Wheat husk contains pentosans which are found to be beneficial.
So it is always useful to take whole wheat bread and avoid maida, bread, pastries and maida sweets.
The right kind of carbohydrates are the single most important element in the diet, they can be the cheapest kind of food, most nourishing and least fattening.
Most common sources of carbohydrates are bread and rice.
Bread has been used since pre-Biblical days.
The dough is kept to ferment.
The risen mass is baked in the oven to form bread.
Some 80 years ago man found that if bran and germ are removed from the flour they can produce white flour which can be kept for years.
Its deficiency in food causes Beri Beri.
Increase fibre in your diet, it has good effect in bringing down cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood.
Patients suffer from lack of concentration, poor memory, anaemia and even psychosis and senility.
Dr Takaki, a naval doctor, studied Beri Beri which was a common occurrence in the Navy.
This was a common condition after a long voyage and half the crew used to be affected by it.
Dr Takaki, after a detailed investigation, concluded that it was a dietary disease and occurred due to polished rice and lack of protein.
On a sea voyage of 9 months he added whole wheat bread and increased the allowance of milk.
He found only 9 cases of Beri Beri out of 300 crew members, whereas earlier their number was 169.
Beri Beri can thus be prevented and cured.
The fibre food needs more chewing and it is bulkier and so more filling and less fattening than low fibre food.
Scurvy is common among the urban poor especially the elderly people whose diet lacks citrus fruits, leafy vegetables and tomatoes.
It could be stored and sold at higher prices.
Deficiency occurs due to food faddism and bizarre nutritional practices.
Pressure cooking is convenient and a quick method of modern cooking.
Sadly it is not that healthy, it takes away all vitamin C from the food due to high temperature.
Scurvy develops in the first year of childhood when cow's milk is not supplemented by citrus fruits juice and vegetables.
In scurvy the common complaint is general malaise, lethargy, weakness, dyspnoea and pain in the bones and joints.
Swelling and bleeding gums are common.
James Lind, a Scottish Naval surgeon, in 1747, showed the good effect of lemon and oranges on scurvy.
Later on, the British army started supplying oranges, lemon and vegetables to their crew.
Vitamin C could cure scurvy.
Today we know a little more that vitamin C is also anti cancer.
Since then we have been using flour (maida) to make bread.
More fruits and vegetables in your diet dilute the carcinogenic effect and help to move your bowels more efficiently.
The use of vitamin C for the treatment or prevention of common colds has aroused great interest.
Available evidence indicates that its use does not reduce the number of episodes of respiratory illness but does decreases the total number of the days of disability.
Sun bathing is healthful and stimulates better bony growth in children.
The main cause of rickets is lack of sunshine, fresh air and exercise.
Sunbathing not only helps in better growth of bones but also in preventing allergy and promotes relaxation.
Nicotinic acid deficiency causes pellagra.
In a survey carried out among 128 cases of pellagra admitted to Udaipur mental hospital it was found that they were mainly eaters of maize.
It occurred due to lack of a water soluble substance, Nicotinic acid, which is found in most grains, except maize and jowar.
It is advisable not to take jowar or maize chapatti all the year round.
The name of "enriched" bread was not heard till World War II.
It is better not to stick to the same pulses.
We may conclude that the simple food is better.
As we get richer, the diet tends to become inferior.
Rich countries suffer from more cases of high blood pressure, heart diseases, cancer and diabetes.
Our ancestors were healthier because they used to take unrefined food.
Diets for gaining or losing weight are based on the amount of calories taken into the body in food and the amount of calories used up in activity.
If people take in more calories than they use up, they gain weight.
Special diets are prescribed for persons suffering from certain diseases.
Many doctors prescribe a low-salt diet for patients with certain heart or kidney diseases.
Some persons suffer allergic or skin reactions from certain food products such as milk, tomatoes, strawberries, wheat, potatoes, eggs, fish, nuts, chocolates or pork.
Enriching consists of adding few cheap synthetic vitamins to wheat flour.
Certain groups of people including younger children and older people have special dietary needs.
A balanced diet contains all the food elements needed to keep a person healthy.
One needs proteins to build tissues and fats and carbohydrates to provide energy and heat.
Minerals and vitamins are needed for growth and to maintain tissues and regulate body functions.
A diet that lacks any needed food element may cause deficiency diseases.
Lack of Vitamin A causes night blindness and lack of Vitamin C leads to scurvy.
The brunt of the side effects of these drugs after prolonged use will fall on the body.
To prevent diseases and bring them under control and to cut drugs to the minimum, dieting is the only means.
Food difficult to digest should not be taken every day.
When taken it should not exceed the fraction of a full meal.
Polishing of rice started almost at a later date but for the same reason.
He adds that if a person takes a suitable diet and practices self control, he lives a full span of 100 years or 36,000 nights without illness.
Ayurveda believed more in prevention of disease and prolonging life rather than in cure.
Patanjali who initiated yoga a few hundred years before Christ has his concern also about food.
Yogis have said that food should be wholesome and should not be eaten only to gratify the senses.
They prescribed sattavic food to the students of yoga.
They believed that character and temperament are influenced by food.
They advised taking pounded rice cooked in milk, and butter added to it.
Yogis further say that only water can quench thirst.
Three things are important in the maintenance of health - diet, exercise and relaxation.
Food should be good to look at and it should have a nice flavour.
If you strip off rice from bran, it looks clean and whiter.
Digestion starts as soon as the eyes see the food and the smell reaches the nostrils, then saliva is secreted.
We should make food simple but at the same time we must use our imagination to make it inviting and appetising.
It is better to inculcate healthy habits in our children.
As soon as you know that a particular food is affecting your health, be prepared to change it.
You will need a strong mind and a will to do it.
Diet is a field where desired amount of research has not been done.
With the arrival of incurable diseases like cancer and Aids, our concern to prevent them is more sincere.
Recently a lot of studies have been made among different populations of the world.
Where diseases are more prevalent, starling facts regarding diet have become a matter of common concern.
In the beginning of the century, American diet consisted 50% calories from carbohydrates, 30% calories from proteins and 20% calories from fats.
It can be stored for years unspoiled by germs.
With affluence, national dairies are churning out a lot of butter, cheese and milk.
The amount of fat in an average American's diet has reached an astounding figure of up to 44% of the total calories.
Food has come to mean a few glasses of milk shakes and big chunk of beef steak.
High amount of cholesterol in American diet has led to an alarming increase in heart disease and strokes.
When food is taken in excess of what the body needs for energy, growth and repair, it gets deposited in parts of the body as fat.
The high density lipoproteins are good for the heart.
Quite a few Americans are turning to vegetarianism and many salad parlours have opened up.
They are getting more conscious of health and are eating a lot of greens and vegetables.
Saturated fat primarily is of animal origin and is found in ghee, butter, egg and meat.
This narrowing is called atherosclerosis which is responsible for heart diseases and high blood pressure.
Bran is one of the richest sources of vitamin B-Complex.
There is another type of fat called unsaturated fat (found in many but not all vegetable oils).
In other words, if you cook with sunflower or soya bean oil, instead of lard or ghee, you will be less susceptible to atherosclerosis.
If you tend to take a lot of unsaturated fat as the Japanese do, the blood will become thinner and the bleeding time will tend to increase.
It would be pertinent to mention that the Japanese have a low incidence of heart disease but a high incidence of strokes (cerebrovascular) diseases.
The great danger is that many people assume that unsaturated fat consumption is healthy.
A recent Norwegian study on likely ways of reducing heart diseases came to the conclusion that the best way to minimise the risk is to cut down on all fats saturated or unsaturated.
The average level of cholesterol in American adult male is 230mgm per 100cc and in rural Japan it is 160 mgm per 100 cc.
Heart diseases are more in the U.S.A. than in Japan.
Strict vegetarian diet contains less cholesterol.
For non-vegetarians mixed diet is ideal.
By judicious dieting cholesterol can be brought down by 15%.
Ayurveda stresses the importance of breast milk.
If you adjust well to the "no breakfast" plan, it may do wonders to your system. Then you can try to improve the dinner and lunch requirements.
If a person consumes 110 grams of sugar per day, he has 5 times more risk of a heart attack than a person consuming only 60g.
He advises to cut down on sweets and alcohol to bring down triglycerides and cholesterol in the blood.
Soviet and American scientists have come together to advise that the more you cut down your daily sugar intake the healthier the heart and body will be.
Sugar which makes our life sweeter in fact makes it bitter and compels us to fall ill and live on borrowed time.
Eminent Soviet cardiologist Dr N.G. Khaltayevr, disputes the popular belief that sugar is harmful to the heart, only if it increases body weight.
Sugar is carbohydrate, full of calories devoid of vitamin, mineral and fibres.
Whatever sugar we eat should be burnt up to produce energy, and if they can't be they will produce health problems.
They selected 10 countries which consume more sugar and 10 countries which consume less sugar.
They found that countries which consume the least amount of sugar have the least number of heart problems.
A further 10% can be brought down by restricting fats in the diet.
The eyes become brighter and more youthful and sight improves by fasting.
The kidney and the liver function better after a fast.
If you are suffering from a severe liver and kidney ailment, better be careful. As these organs help in the excretion of body's morbid matter during a fast, their load of work increases.
The skin becomes fresh and youthful.
Wrinkles, blotches, decolouration and pimples disappear during fasting.
At the initial stage of a fast, the pulse rate may rise.
Slowly it comes down and settles at approx. 40 beats per minute.
It rises again to about 60 beats at the end of the fast.
The pulse rate may come down even as low as 20 beats per minute.
If the pulse rate remains either too low or too high for a long period, it is the call for breaking the fast.
It has been estimated that if the above restrictions are observed, reduction by two fold in the risk of heart diseases is possible.
Those suffering from a heart condition may notice that the variation in their pulse rate is much more and it can become erratic.
If it remains erratic for a long time the patient should discontinue fasting.
Many are afraid of fasting.
They have the notion that if they fast they will become weak and will be moving closer to the grave.
They link fasting with starving.
It takes a lot of will power.
We also read about people trapped in house crashes, surviving without food or water for many days of this ordeal.
Those who die they do so not of starvation but some other different causes including shock or fear.
Men lost in the desert or trapped in a ship wreck die usually of thirst and not of starvation.
Those lost in the polar region are likely to die of extreme cold and not the lack of food as it is erroneously believed.
High pressure publicity in the media makes one believe that baby food is good and even better then breast milk.
In the mines, for instance, the workers are usually exposed to poisonous gases or foul air which brings about their ultimate end.
In famine conditions in some countries of Asia and Africa, people do not get adequate food.
If a well fed and healthy animal is starved to death the length of time it takes to reach its doom will depend on the condition of its body and the stored fat.
It has been noticed that he loses almost half the body weight before dying.
In a few instances he may lose as much as 60% of his body weight.
However, he can recover completely, if fed.
A healthy man with an average weight will lose almost half his body weight before death by starvation.
A human being would lose almost one pound each day while fasting.
Now, suppose we have a therapeutic fast in the same person for 30 days, he will lose almost 1/5th of his weight and he is quite safe.
It has been seen that during fasting a man loses almost one pound per day in the first week, three to four pounds in the following week, and for the fifth week onwards only 1-2 pounds weekly.
After the hue and cry of the medical men and scientists some restrictions have been put on such advertising and an effort has been made to tell people that breast milk is better than baby food.
We can conclude therefore that overweighing persons can undergo longer fasts much safely than those who are slim.
Slimmer persons need not subject themselves to fasts, they can take a shorter fasting period and if needed repeat it after about three months.
A fast lasting a few days will clean the elementary canal and free it from the circulation or morbid matter.
This will itself lead to an initial appreciable loss in weight.
It could be 2-5 pounds a day in the beginning.
This reduction would include the loss of water which is caused due to the stopping of the daily intake of common salt.
This creates the illusion that the weight is lost quickly in the first few days of the fast.
But that part of the body which is not fat will be regained when normal eating is resumed.
The real reduction is due to the consumption of body fat as fuel during fasting.
A pound of body fat is equal to 3000 calories.
It is compulsory to write on every tin of baby food that breast milk is superior to baby food.
During fasting the actual weight loss is little more than these figures because some non-fatty tissues are also lost.
During a rigorous, full fasting period, the muscles, blood, liver and other vital organs lose weight, but, surprisingly, not the brain.
The average man doing a moderate amount of exercise and not engaged in heavy physical labour loses about a pound a day.
The loss of phosphorus is negligible at the beginning and at the end of the 21st day of the fasting experience as well.
The loss of potassium was nearly three times at the beginning than at the end of the 21st day of fasting.
The sodium which is always in excess than required by the body because of our habits and the custom of adding a good measure of common salt (sodium chloride) to our food gets secreted out heavily during fasting.
We can see that the sodium extracted from the body in the beginning of the fast is almost 30 times than that lost on the 21st day.
Fasting calls for a strong mind and a proper atmosphere.
If you have friends around you to encourage you while on fast then it becomes easy.
During fasting, you become mentally weak due to increasing weakness.
It has been proved beyond doubt in reputed Indian and International medical journals that breast milk is the best.
To continue fasting you have to keep your eyes on a set target.
You have to remind yourself about the many benefits that are going to come your way, health-wise at the end of the fast.
During fasting you don't lose strength quickly.
For the first 2-3 days you can easily do your routine work.
If your work is not strenuous, you can continue doing so, for a few days more.
If you are fasting while suffering from cold, fever or diarrhoea, you must take complete rest for a quicker response.
Acute disease calls for immediate fasting and fast even if you are thin because it will need 3-4 days of fasting only.
If you have chronic diseases, fast only after a good preparation.
People who are bodily strong can go for a longer fast for one, two or even three weeks.
Do not venture into a long fast, if you have not fasted before.
Breast fed children have fewer allergies and illnesses.
For the beginners I would recommend Dr. Dewey's "no breakfast" plan.
This method was popular in the U .S .A.
Dr. Dewey asked his patients to stop taking breakfast.
Give rest to your digestive system till lunch time.
But a word of caution, don't overeat at brunch.
If you eat 25 or 50 percent more after missing breakfast the whole purpose will be lost.
Dr. Dewey's observation was that in spite of the fact that different doctors give different medicines to their patients; the percentage of cures remains the same.
He concluded that medicine hardly played any role in curing diseases.
He happened to examine a poor young girl patient.
Due to her pain she could not even digest water.
The antibodies from the mother's blood are transferred to babies through breast milk.
Being poor she could not afford medicines.
On her own, after a few days of fast she was able to retain water.
Gradually she started gaining strength.
Her skin became clear and the tongue clean and red.
On the 35th day she asked for food and that was retained too.
Her fever was gone, her pulse rate became normal and in a few days she was healthier than before.
Dr. Dewey was amazed because he knew that if this girl had been forcibly fed and given medicine, she would have died.
Dr. Dewey believed in giving minimum drugs to his patients, like a simple pain killer if the pain was too much or a purgative if the patient had no motion.
As food he would suggest a little boiled rice water or porridge.
He did not prescribe milk.
Have smaller quantities and at the main meals have salads and green vegetables.
Though its origin is lost in the midst of time, the custom of going on fast has played a crucial role in the practice of major religions.
During small illness like cold, flu, diarrhoea or mild pain, go on a short fast.
In ancient religions, fasting had been related to the desire to keep gods friendly, or to improve food supply.
Religious groups, through fasting, seek pardon for their misdeeds and sins.
A fast in some religions is undertaken during mourning.
In others, people believe that fasting will lift their minds away from physical things and produce a state of spiritual joy and happiness.
There are important days of fasting in Hinduism, Islam, Christianity or Jainism to mention a few.
Jewish law orders a yearly fast on Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement.
Christians have some food during the fasting days.
Buddhists and Hindus fast regularly, particularly during religious occasions.
Mahatma Gandhi used fasting, both as a penance and as a political weapon of protest.
This will prepare you to go on a 3 day's fast and get used to the idea of fasting.
Scientists have studied the effects of fasting on the body.
They know that the intake of food affects the body by increasing its metabolism.
After fasting, metabolism can become as much as 22 per cent lower than the normal rate.
But research has also shown that after long periods of fasting, the body tends to adjust itself by lowering the rate of metabolism by itself.
After fasting, a person should gradually resume eating.
Religious groups believe that a fast promotes self-control and strengthens the will.
He did it sitting in the same posture.
The bones were used as weapons by Asuras.
Needles to say, they won the battle.
This is only one of the many mythical stories.
The body will get rid of smaller quantities of morbid matter during these small fasts; you will not have violent reactions as it may occur in long fasts.
The description of many long fasts and meditation has been given in the Bhagwat Gita and Ramayana.
Fasting has helped in achieving longevity.
It can store energy which helps to improve health, carry on daily rituals with zeal and achieve greater goals.
Not long ago, an Irish leader Bobby Sands died after 66 days of hunger strike in the Belfast jail, in Northern Ireland.
Bobby Sands, who was then 27, spent one third of his life in jail.
The fast was carried out by this intrepid young man under the observant eyes of the jail authorities.
A doctor used to visit him every day.
Prior to his death every day a bulletin on his health was issued to the Press describing in detail his condition.
Fast 'unto death' has become fashionable.
It is a weapon in the hands of leaders who press for their demands.
When you get acquainted better with fast and its benefits, you will understand the body and how it will react during fasting.
In religion, fasting is an old practice.
Religious leaders knew the advantages of fasting for health and incorporated in such a way that this should become a part of their mundane existence.
In a way, fasting was prevalent in the pre-historic period.
Our ancestors lived in the jungle.
They had to depend for food on herbs and fruits or animals.
They had to remain hungry for days on end.
Probably this was the reason they were fit and in the best of health.
This was essential to live in jungle conditions and be fit for hunting.
They could survive, only if they were fit.
We have a natural instinct, an appetite and a call for food by the body when required.
You may then be prepared for a much longer fast.
With the addition of condiments and frying, we make the food suitable for our taste and we tend to overeat.
We eat too frequently and so we don't know what "real" appetite is.
Gradually we lose the natural instinct of the body i.e. appetite, the call of body for food when it requires it.
Fasting has been described as avoiding all eatables, except water.
As appetite is an instinct in man, it is so in animals too.
An animal stops eating when it is sick and has no appetite.
The silver salmon fasts for weeks while swimming upstream for hundreds of miles in search of spawning fish eggs.
The queen ant eats nothing until the eggs are hatched.
Many insects and animals abstain from food during hibernation.
Hippocrates, the father of medicine, recommended fasting to many of his patients.
I have found that people have addiction for a certain type of food.
He said "when you feed the sick, you feed the disease", On the other hand if you withhold food, disease ebbs away.
Many great men of history and science fasted.
Socrates and Plato fasted for 10 days to attain mental and physical fitness.
Jesus fasted for 40 days in the mountain and thus could not be tempted by the devil.
Moses fasted and prayed for many days in the mountains.
Gandhiji did many fasts lasting 21 days.
Pythagoras fasted for 40 days before taking the examination at the University of Alexandria.
Mohammad and Buddha fasted for many days.
In Germany at Bad Pyrmont in Buchinger Sanatorium 70,000 juice fasts were conducted for a period of 48 years.
At natural Hygiene resorts Dr. Albert Burton conducted thousands of fasts.
Unless they eat the same stimulating food that they have been taking all along and have become accustomed, they will not feel satisfied.
Great Paracelsus once said "fasting is the greatest physician within".
Arab physician Avicenna prescribed fasting for 3-5 weeks.
Plutarch said "instead of using medicine, better fast a day".
In Germany, Dr. Adolph Mayor said "fasting is the most efficient means of correcting any disease".
Experimenters, Dr. Carlson and Dr. Kunde of Department of Physiology, University of Chicago, kept a 30-year-old man on a 14-day fast.
They found that at the end of the fast his tissues were in the physiological condition as that of a 17 year old youth.
Dr. Kunde said that, during the fast, the weight came down by 45%.
On 18th may, 1933 when Gandhiji was on his 10th day of fasting, he was examined by his physicians.
One of them commenting on Gandhiji's health said "from the physiological point of view the Indian leader was as healthy as a man of forty".
The total loss of weight was nearly 38lbs from the original body weight of 157 lbs.
When you miss a meal, the craving for food becomes great.
Dr. Vithal Das Modi, a pioneer of nature cure in India, has supervised 35,000 fasts in his hospital Arogya Mandir, At Gorakhpur, during 48 years of his work.
He has undertaken a fast for 40 days and written a diary of this fast published in Hindi Up was se labh (Benefit of fasting).
It is not correct to think that a person becomes frail and weak with fasting.
During fasting the senses become acute.
Even a little smell of food can assail your nostrils.
During a fast, a person can see better, hear better and think better.
The taste buds on the tongue become extra sensitive after the fast.
Even simple food tastes good.
You may sleep less, during the fast.
But if you have been suffering from insomnia you are likely to have better sleep, for as many as 20 hours a day.
Like an addict whose drug has been withheld you will get withdrawal symptoms.
Fasting helps the heart, arteries and blood.
The cholesterol level in the blood goes down.
Fasting helps to bring down the low density lipoproteins in the blood which are bad for the heart and raise the high density lipoproteins which are good for the heart.
Blood engorgement in the blood vessels is reduced and so is blood pressure.
The congestion of lungs is brought down by fasting.
You can breathe in more air and much easily after a fast.
Try to fight the urge to take food in spite of such a great upheaval inside the body.
These symptoms will disappear slowly as the body's reserves begin nourishing the body.
Do not worry; try to live on fruits for one day.
Take one fruit at a time, 3 times a day.
Stop taking food completely.
Suddenly you get the nagging feeling that your condition has deteriorated.
In winter, sunbathing can be enjoyed anytime of the day behind a window glass, thus avoiding bad effects of excessive ultra-violet rays.
Do not panic when you reach this stage.
Crisis is a welcome sign.
It is the body's way of telling you that it is making an effort to throw the waste out of the body.
This is when the toxic material is diverted into the blood stream for elimination.
The effects of crisis may result in the retention of urine, diarrhoea, headaches, vomiting, and insomnia.
It may occur due to worry or lack of sleep.
At this point of time the patient needs a lot of rest, fresh air and sunshine.
The sunshine during fasting is tempting.
It should be had for a short duration and taken in early hours of the morning or late in evening when the rays of the sun are mild.
You may be ready to do your fast for 3 days now.
The duration of sun bathing should be gradually reduced as the fasting progresses.
You should try to drink hot water, may add fresh lime to it.
If you can have a 3 day's fast on your own, you can do so later for 7 days.
Do not have a prolonged fast without the help of a good guide.
You can fast, but the guide will hold your hand and take you to your goal safely.
He will give you encouragement, he will warn you about the bad spells that might occur during the fast and get you prepared to face them.
If you need to have a long fast gets admitted to a suitable health farm.
There will be many patients fasting together.
They act as a source of encouragement to each other.
Fasting in a group is much easier.
Drink plenty of water.
Gandhiji suggested taking hot water with fresh lime, salt and soda bicarbonate.
This will help to overcome and get relief from the crisis symptoms.
Some others advise taking honey along with hot water and lime, two full teaspoons thrice a day.
This will provide strength and help to overcome the crisis.
During fasts, hunger will vanish after five days.
The pulse rate slows down, blood pressure decreases.
The secretion in the stomach is reduced.
The stomach as a routine expects food every day and it keeps on secreting gastric juices in anticipation.
After 3 days, the stomach becomes sure that food will not come and the secretion will be slowly reduced.
This is why after 3 days of fasting the pain of peptic ulcer vanishes.
You can continue with your work.
In a health farm you can rest physically and mentally.
I have conducted two three-week fasting sessions with a few hundred patients.
I have found that fasting for 40 days, can be safe.
My advice is to have shorter fasts of 2-3 weeks and repeat them after a few months if required.
If you cannot fast, you may go on an eliminative diet.
Eat fresh fruits (except banana) and drink juices for a few days or take to soups and boiled vegetables for a few days.
This dietary control for a week or two, along with a lot of rest will work a miracle.
It will help in cases of peptic ulcer and may cause the wounds to heal completely.
After 3 days the eyes will become brighter, the hearing becomes acute and the red cells in the blood increase in number.
This is why it helps in cases of anaemia also.
If you feel feverish or weak, take rest.
As the fast nears completion the taste in the mouth improves, nausea disappears, the tongue become clear and pink, the breath become odourless, the stomach starts secreting again and hunger returns.
The mind becomes clear and calmness dawns over the body and mind as if you are becoming prepared to see God.
This is the time for breaking the fast.
It is very important to slow down while breaking the fast.
Go slow on your food on the first day and increase your meals as the days go by.
The "crisis" does appear in an eliminative diet but it is not of a violent nature and is therefore easier to handle.
If you have undergone eliminative diet for 2-3 weeks, you will later on find that you can undertake a longer fast, the crisis will be much less and you will be able to go on longer fast without upheavals.
During fast the digestive system tends to reduce digestive juices.
Now just as you would to a toddler, you will have to coax your digestive system into the processes of digestion.
This is done slowly. Generally, it takes an equal number of days as fasting to come to a normal diet.
If you suffer from a chronic disease you may go on a longer fast.
In the beginning, the fasting person should take easily digestible things where hardly any digestive juices are required.
On the second day take one orange every two hours.
On the third day, have one peach or one pear or one handful of grapes three times a day.
On the fourth day, have 2 pieces of fruit for breakfast and 3 pieces for lunch and dinner.
On the fifth day, have two varieties of fruit at a time for breakfast and lunch and boiled vegetables at dinner.
On the sixth day, have vegetable soup, for lunch and dinner.
On the seventh day, have fruits for breakfast, soup at lunch and boiled vegetables for dinner.
On the eighth day, have fruits for breakfast and one chapatti with boiled vegetables at lunch and dinner.
On the ninth day, add a cup of milk with fruits for breakfast, boiled vegetables plus two chapattis for lunch and dinner.
On the tenth day, add a small portion of dal for lunch and dinner.
A word of caution, fasting is not the remedy for all ills.
Gradually, add a little fat in your meals, ghee or oil while cooking vegetables or apply a little ghee to your chapattis.
The assimilation power of the body increases after a fast.
After the food is properly digested and absorbed by the body, changes begin occurring in the blood.
The number of red blood corpuscles increases after fasting.
It has been mentioned that in one case the RBC count increased from 1 million to 5 million after the fast.
The iron and other elements which are stored in the body are taken and used by the body.
Assimilation after a fast is at its highest level.
A group of rabbits were put on a fast for 17 days.
They slowly gained 56% of the body weight to the normal level after fasting.
Broken bones and wound heal more rapidly during fasting.
Do not fast if you have diseases like T .B., leprosy, cancer or heart diseases.
Inflammation subsides faster and the body tends to become youthful.
Fasting gives the body organs a complete rest.
The work load that organs normally do is reduced.
As no food is taken in no digestion or assimilation takes place.
So all energy required is saved and utilized for eliminating the morbid matter from the body.
Organs get rest, they recuperate and regain their vital powers.
The elementary canal becomes free of unfriendly bacteria.
More nourishment is derived from less essential tissues.
The effusion, swelling, fat, infiltration etc is absorbed rapidly.
So the body gradually frees itself from surplus waste material.
There is always an element of "crisis" during a fast.
Enema is feared by most people, but it is the most innocent and least harmful of all forms of purgation.
One - two litres of water at body temperature is introduced through the anus buy the help of a nozzle.
The water reaches the lower portion of the colon.
This water is retained for 2/3 minutes and then expelled out mechanically along with the retained wastes.
There is a controversy about the use of enema.
A few recommend enema every day of the fast.
Some favour only sparse use of enema and some do not recommend it at all.
People, who advocate enema every day, feel that the morbid matter which had reached the rectum and descending colon should not be allowed to be stored there, as it might get reabsorbed by the circulating blood.
Sunbathing in the morning or evening hours is just sufficient for the vitamin D formation and not sufficient to burn the skin.
The sun's rays when they pass through the window glass have most of its ultraviolet content absorbed.
The soothing and relaxing effect of the sun is due to its heating effect.
Melanin is the pigment in the skin which gives a dark colour.
The long dark winter of North India and many North European countries, also lead to a forced and prolonged confinement of infants indoors.
Among the whites, melanin pigments are present in the deeper layers of the skin called the malpighian layer.
It is common knowledge that exposure to midday summer sun results in the reddening of the skin.
After a few days, the erythema fades gradually and is replaced by brown colouration due to accumulation of melanin pigments, called "sun-tan".
About 20 hours after exposure to ultraviolet rays, some of this melanin begins to migrate towards the surface.
Following this, there is the production of new pigments in the basal cell layer, thus the skin starts getting darker after regular sunbathing.
When these people return to work after holidaying in the sun the skin remains tanned for a few weeks.
Thereafter, the melanin pigments become much lighter.
But they become darker if exposed to ultraviolet rays for a few days.
If exposed too long, there may be some blistering and peeling off of the superficial layer called "sun-burn".
We have a feeling of well being during sun bathing.
Among the Negroes, the sun burn is much less severe and erythema may be slight due to the presence of excessive pigments in the skin.
In all parts of the world they are trying to harvest the cheap source of energy from the sun.
If the skin is subjected to increasing intensities of heat, the sensation of warmth, heat and pain are elicited successively.
The amount of radiant energy required to produce skin damage is about 10 times than that required to produce pain.
This is why a direct exposure to sun never produces a burn.
Pain and burning can occur if the sunlight is focussed with a lens.
When a person is sunbathing he usually feels the sensation of mild warmth from sunlight, unless the skin happens to be already irritated by sunburn.
The body gives out a certain amount of heat all the time from its own metabolism.
The channels of loss are conduction, convection (evaporation of sweat and moisture from lungs) and radiation.
Thus when we are exposed to ice, we lose heat.
Heat reduces pain in the body and relaxes the muscles.
We gain it from hot rocks.
The same is true of the solar energy.
When the sun is too hot we receive heat from the sun.
Part of it comes directly and part of it after getting reflected from the terrain.
If a man walks in a desert at the rate of 3 miles per hour he will lose approximately 882g of water in one hour.
This is why those who work in a hot climate feel thirsty most of the time.
Humidity also makes a lot of difference.
If sunbathing is done on the rock or near green foliage, the temperature will be low near the green foliage than on the rock due to the evaporation of water from the greenery.
Evaporation adjusts itself to sweating in such a way that the body temperature does not rise excessively.
There is some confusion over whether the protection of the body from the sun is only done by the formation of melanin pigmentation.
This way you can also avoid the cold draft due to the high velocity of the wind.
One more important factor that comes into reckoning is the thickening of the superficial layer of the skin called epidermal thickening.
The result of the action of the ultraviolet radiation on the skin is rapid.
It causes proliferation of the two layers of epidermis - the corneum and the malpighian.
The thickening of corneum results in marked decrease in the amount of sunburn, reducing radiation that reaches the malpighian layer.
Thus the effectiveness of corneum as filter is increased.
The skin becomes less sensitive to sunburn.
Among the black skinned, the thickening of the corneum is the principal means for the protection of the skin from sunburn, apart from melanin formation.
Skin cancer is caused due to prolonged and excessive exposure to the sun.
This is more common among the white skinned people and less among Negroes.
The eyes are our most prized possession.
The effect of sunbathing will depend upon the clothing.
If the sun's rays reach in a big quantity to the image producing screen of the eyes, the retina, it may get damaged.
Our elders advise us not to look at the solar eclipse directly.
It could cause eclipse blindness.
Such symptoms may also occur when the sun is bright over a snow field.
When there is a good deal of diffused reflection of the sunlight that reaches the eyes, it may lead to "snow blindness".
Normally, the wave lengths of the sun's rays which can cause damage to the retina are absorbed in the superficial layers of the eyes and do not cause any damage.
When the sun is bright, it is better to wear good quality sunglasses.
These should be designed in a way that they reduce the total amount of energy reaching the retina.
It is not true that ultraviolet rays can cause cataract.
This however can be brought about by lower temperature sources such as glass blowers furnaces which we call "glass blower's cataract".
White cloth reflects sunrays and so it has a cooling effect.
The sun has many good effects on the body apart from the environmental factors.
It influences the temperature of wind and ocean currents.
It has its effect on rainfall and the most important of all, photosynthesis of plants.
The development of life on the earth was made possible by the steady flow of light and heat from the sun.
Life would be endangered if the sun's heat and light were to vary; either it would be too hot or too cold to live.
Life also depends on the sun for food.
The heat of the sun is trapped by the atmosphere which lets sunlight through to the surface of the earth.
The light warms the earth but the heat it creates cannot easily pass through the atmosphere into space.
This is known as the "greenhouse" effect.
This is what happens when the glass roof lets the sunlight in to heat the plants in the greenhouse but it passes back through the roof only very slowly.
If clothes are dark, they absorb most of the heat and have a warming effect.
Plants make their own food through photosynthesis (they combine energy from sunlight with carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil to make food).
In the process they give off oxygen.
Men and animals breathe this oxygen released by the plants and exhale the carbon dioxide which in turn is used by plants.
Sunbath is the exposure of the body to sunlight or to sun lamps.
Sunlight is made up of many different kinds of light rays.
Infrared rays penetrate deeply into the body.
They benefit the circulatory system and the muscles.
Ultraviolet rays are chiefly absorbed by the skin and may cause sun burns and tanning.
They also cause chemicals in the skin to produce Vitamin D, the sunshine vitamin.
Sun lamps produce ultraviolet rays.
It is a common practice among the whites to sunbathe for tanning their skins.
Today we acknowledge the sun as a source of light, heat and other kinds of energy.
Lives of men, animals and plants depend entirely on the energy of the sun.
The sun can be blazing and hot in summer in the deserts of Rajasthan.
The air is hot as if it is blowing straight from the oven.
It can burn the skin and give a sun-stroke.
Above all it is most important for our overall immunity and physical and emotional stability.
The effect of the rays of the sun directly spreading on the human body, with which we are here concerned, may be a nuisance to those in the tropics.
The effect of sunlight is two-fold as it causes photochemical reactions and heating effects.
We know now that the solar ultraviolet radiation is necessary for synthesis of calciferol, the forerunner of vitamin D.
Calciferol is released into the blood stream by the skin.
After regular sunbathing, their skin takes a dark tan which they consider makes them look more beautiful.
This hormone is released when sunlight falls on the skin.
Without calciferol not enough calcium would be laid in growing bones.
Where it is not available, one comes across crippling deformities and rickets.
Adequate sunlight is necessary for a proper growth of bones and the prevention of rickets.
The photochemical effects are restricted to a limited spectrum.
The vision, for example, falls between approximately 0.4m and 0.65m wave lengths of sun light rays which is the important part of the sunlight.
The sun light reaches the surface of the earth after passing through the atmosphere.
The ozone layer of the atmosphere absorbs the ultraviolet and infra red rays
Solar radiation may be blocked by many means.
Among them is the industrial smog seen in Mumbai and London and other polluted places.
This well explains why osteomalacia and rickets are common in Great Britain, Scandinavian countries, Middle East and India than in the United States.
The effect of ultraviolet rays on common cold is well known.
You will never know when you go into the lovely arms of the lady sleep.
A group of subjects exposed to ultraviolet radiation reported about 40% lesser colds.
In olden times, sunbathing was prescribed for tuberculosis.
The beneficial effect was due to sunbathing and a general improvement in the regimen.
After the manufacture of anti-tubercular drugs, generally a change of place or stay in a sanatorium for a few months is not prescribed.
When the ultraviolet rays pass through the ozone layer of the atmosphere, a major portion gets absorbed.
At mid day, when the sun is at ninety degrees it passes through a much thinner layer of atmosphere and also a thinner layer of ozone.
The content of ultraviolet rays is then excessive and can cause sun burns.
Before 8 am or after 4 pm when the sun is at an angle it passes through a much thicker layer of atmosphere and ozone.
So the content of ultraviolet rays is less and sufficient for body needs.
To avoid rickets and osteomalacia, give plenty of milk to children and expose them to sunlight.
The ultraviolet rays are needed for the formation of vitamin D in the skin.
On this mind-television recorder, you have control when you are aware.
It works according to certain logic.
When you sleep, your mind with logic also goes to sleep.
There is no logic, there is no sequence.
This mind television recorder goes haywire in any direction.
It flows like a cinema reel in front of you with pictures, sound, everything.
You are also a participant to whatever is happening on the screen, you react to the happening, you feel agitated in your mind, you get tensed up, and you feel as if the body is bruised.
You feel the brunt of all the sequences, but you cannot turn the direction of the sequence: it just happens and you participate in it.
It appears that you dream about your unfulfilled desires, sufferings and tortures.
Osteomalacia has been observed in 25 to 30% of bone biopsies among elderly patients who have suffered hip fracture in Scandinavia and Great Britain.
There are no limitations to what you can do or what can be done to the body.
You may fly like a bird, drive a plane, slip from the hill and fall, fight a tiger.
You may meet the worst accident, you may even get killed, but you are there suffering all this mentally and physically.
You may be in a park, seashore, or meet a girl, talk to her, take her out and have moments of pleasure.
You get up tired, agitated, bruised even if you get a night emission.
You get up more tired than when you went to bed, you feel weak as if somebody has extracted all the energy, and you feel morose.
Many a time dreams linger in the mind even after you wake up, and may fill you with grief and sorrow.
A good quality sleep should not allow you to have dreams or should allow having them at a minimum possible level.
You try hard and you can achieve it.
It will need time, perseverance and genuine effort.
Most likely, this is because of lower vitamin D intake and reduced sunlight exposure.
Simulate your body into a bag of cloth; quieten your mind before you go to sleep.
Talk to your brain as if you were talking to another person.
Do not get agitated or irritated, do this in a polite way, clearly, again and again.
You will be surprised that in a few days it will start working, you will see less and less dreams.
If a lie is repeated a hundred times it becomes true.
This formula is used to prove that by mere repetition on radio, television or news magazines we begin believing in things.
Mind is malleable, if you pursue you are bound to succeed.
Meditation for five to ten minutes before you go to sleep is recommended.
Meditation teaches conscious control on your unconscious mind.
I know of a way which has given success to many sufferers.
Rickets among children are due to lack of vitamin D.
This meditation is called Vippassana meditation.
The meditation should always be done with the help of a teacher.
It is a practical training like a senior surgeon teaching surgery to juniors.
Let me cite a few basic preliminary steps of this Vippassana meditation called Ana-Pan.
You can try them at your home.
With persistence you are bound to achieve success.
The technique is simple, but you do not learn it in a day, if you pursue it may take a week, ten days or even a month to learn.
Feel your breath, concentrate on your breathing, the air going into your nostrils and going out of them.
When it does so it touches the upper lips area around and inside the nostrils.
You are breathing all the time but you are hardly aware of it.
Osteomalacia among the elderly is also due to lack of vitamin D.
If you concentrate on breath you will feel the air passing over the upper lips and the area around the nostrils.
If you still cannot feel it, take a few fast breaths.
When you can feel, slow it down, come back to your normal breathing and keep on feeling the touch of air on the upper lip and nostrils.
Gradually your sensitivity will go on increasing, in a few days you will feel the air entering and leaving the nostrils and touching all around.
Do it for 10-15 minutes or till you fall asleep.
After a few days you will see that your dreams are becoming less and less, and you are able to achieve good quality sleep.
It is like asking a child who is not allowing you to do work, to go up and down the stairs and continue doing so till you tell him to stop.
When you go to sleep while feeling the sensations of your breath, this job is taken over from your conscious mind to your unconscious mind.
The mind will be busy the whole night feeling the sensations of breath and thus forget to dream.
We all have a cycle of sleep.
The prevention and cure of rickets by the formation of vitamin D through the skin by sunlight is of course firmly established.
We get better sleep if we go to sleep at a particular hour.
For a few of us this cycle is at 9.00pm, 10.00pm or in few cases it may be as late as 4.00 am.
People who travel extensively around the world experience it more intensely.
Regular air travellers suffer from mild to serious jet lag symptoms.
Crossing the time zone is known to disrupt the normal circadian rhythm.
If you have had a late night, you cannot make up for the lost sleep by going to bed early the next night.
Researchers at Stanford University and Montefine Hospital in New York have found that the body is not like a battery that needs to be recharged with rest each night.
Sleeping and wakefulness are related to body temperature.
This determines when a person can get proper sleep.
If he breaks with the temperature cycle by sleeping early for instance he will have a fitful unsatisfactory rest.
Sunbathing has been advocated for keeping the cold away, developing immunity and robust health.
People, who sleep long, say sixteen hours, do so because they sleep through two cycles for lack of an effective body wake-up signal.
Hydrotherapy is known to help the insomniacs in a big way.
Many treatments are useful to achieve good quality sleep.
A relaxed body will help achieve good sleep.
The temperature rhythms of the body can be altered with the help of different water treatments.
If you sleep in a room which is overcrowded or poorly ventilated your sleep will not be refreshing.
If you live in a congested area or in a noisy and busy road side or beside a railway track, your sleep will be disturbed.
The body gets used to noise to a large extent.
After a few days the noise does not affect your sleep to a great extent, but if you are a light sleeper it will affect your sleep.
Try to live in a quieter place or at least install an air conditioner to improve the situation if you cannot get sleep.
When we take a sun bath it helps to relieve body pain and is relaxing.
If you cannot sleep, never mind, get up.
For example, sit in front of, say a tiny fish aquarium on an easy chair and watch the tiny fishes with bright colours.
Try not to think of anything else, watch the fishes coming and going, swimming, gliding, turning, meeting, crossing, chasing one another.
Watch them as a child would.
A child enjoys these things more easily.
He imagines things much faster.
You tell the child a story and you can carry him to another world of fantasy and he enjoys it thoroughly.
Try to be like a child.
Think you are a fish and you are swimming in the water, gliding, turning, changing direction, flicking in a cold and clear water and all this is so pleasant, after a while you will feel drowsy, and it's time to get up and go to bed.
Another method would be to put on a tape - Bhajan, Ghazal or Classical music anything you like the most and listen.
Do not invite it, do not crave for sleep, just lie down and relax.
Non-sleepers lose contact with reality and begin day dreaming.
Increase the duration of retention and the number of cycles as per your capacity.
When a person falls asleep, all activity decreases and muscles relax.
The heartbeat and breathing rate slow down.
As a person sleeps, the brain sends slower but larger and larger waves (through the electroencephalograph which is used to measure it).
Most adults sleep for 7 to 8 1/2 hours every night.
Some adults can manage with only six hours of sleep.
At 60, people may need less than seven hours of sleep.
We require both slow-wave sleep and dreaming sleep.
Extra sleep of either kind does not make up for a lack of the other.
Slow-wave sleep helps to restore the control of the brain and nervous system over the muscles, glands, and other body systems.
If you are not able to sleep do not get worried because even if you do not sleep the whole night, just lie down and relax for eight hours.
Dreaming sleep may be important to keep up with mental activities like learning, reasoning, and emotional adjustment.
Scientists are trying to find out why human beings need to sleep and how it restores vigour to the body.
For instance, insects do not sleep, they simply rest.
Sleep is the period of rest during which the sleeper loses awareness of his surroundings.
Good quality sleep is essential for good health.
It will bring down the blood pressure, alleviate allergy, calm down gastric problems and will soothe the nerves.
You will get up with a clear mind, full of energy and with a bouncing heart.
You will be able to take on physical labour and the tension of the day without getting tired.
As soon as they put their head to the pillow, in no time they are in a deep sleep.
Sleep does have different depths at different hours of the night.
It is equal to four hours of deep sleep.
For instance, thieves are active always around the early hours of the morning around 2.00 am when most of the people are in deep slumber and noise, often, does not seem to wake them up.
There are also people who dread nights because each night to them is a struggle to get some sleep.
They get up tired, morose and literally have to push themselves to do their daily work.
In the process, they get tired quickly during the day.
It may happen to a top executive, to a businessman fighting too many problems all the time, to an affluent housewife, to a man overtired with physical labour or even to a girl in her thirties losing her charm fast and finding herself less attractive to boys, and in a hurry to be hooked in marriage.
Less sleep produces black circles round the eyes and takes away the shine from the skin thus making it less attractive.
Boys who have finished their education and are looking forward to start their career and not able to do so, may not sleep adequately.
Sleep is disturbed when you have a maladjusted family.
When the wife does not co-operate with the husband
If you have taken a loan and are not able to pay it back.
Thus you will never suffer due to lack of sleep.
Any worry can put you off from sleep.
All of us dream, mostly in the early hours of the morning, when sleep is light.
They could be pleasant dreams.
Many have difficulty getting sleep and when they do get to sleep, they have horrible dreams which turn into nightmares.
These dreams are unpleasant.
Some see tigers, cats, snakes, or else they find their body falling down from a hill.
They seem to face a great danger not being able to dress up properly or put on their shoes or even walk.
Your legs have gone heavy you are not able to walk; you are trying to run but are not able to put your foot forward.
You see the same dream night after night.
You wake up tired, morose, without any zeal in the heart, you feel weak as if somebody has drained you of all the energy, the mind is fogged and the head is heavy.
It will not hamper your work, so be assured, if you crave for sleep you drive it away.
You are exhausted and have no enthusiasm to work.
The sleeping condition can never be achieved through personal efforts.
It comes of its own accord after the cessation of all mental activities.
But you can do it by preparing mentally: a good background in an effort to get good quality sleep.
Do not go to sleep immediately if you are overtired or tensed.
Take a little more time before you go to bed.
Let your thoughts concentrated on the aching muscles and try to relax them one by one.
Loosen your nerves till the body feels like a crumpled piece of cloth in your own bed as if you have no muscles and no bones.
After you have done so, do the same thing with your mind.
Do not concentrate on any specific idea, quieten your thoughts, do not try to solve any problem.
After two days without sleep, they lose concentration.
Try to remove all the ideas, impressions, sensations you had in the day.
Do not force the pace, do this quietly as if you are talking and persuading your mind.
As days of continuous effort go by, you will realise you can do much better every time.
If you can master the sleep technique, you will feel relaxed and feel that the body is like a piece of cloth and that you are thoroughly relaxed from toe to head.
Just keep yourself in a tranquil condition.
You will never realise, when you drop into a restful refreshing sleep.
If you persevere in this exercise you will succeed and one day you will be able to master it.
Sleep will no more be a problem
There are doctors who recommend meditation for five to ten minutes before going to bed.
At all costs, avoid taking a sleeping pill even if you cannot get proper sleep.
Many mistakes are made even in their ordinary, routine tasks.
The sleep you get after swallowing a sleeping pill is not a good quality sleep.
Next morning you may have a hangover, feel drowsy and the greatest drawback of all is that you may get addicted to the pill and may not be able to sleep without taking the pill.
There are countless dreams without any connection or interest.
The mind is like a television camera.
It records all thoughts, experiences, happenings, pleasant moments, dreadful moments, childhood, school days, college days, sorrows and excitements, failures, achievements, tortures done on yourself and all these things come back to you.
It records like an unconcerned machine and records all the events that comes in its way.
When you feel you can easily hold your breath longer, prolong the period to 10-15 seconds.
If you feel tension around the temple or head or tightness in the lungs, it means you are exceeding the limit.
After completing this practice take a few deep breaths and do savasana.
It develops harmony between the nerves and the mind.
Anyone who goes without sleep for three days may have great difficulty in thinking, seeing and hearing clearly.
If done correctly, you will feel yourself brimming with energy.
It will increase your capacity to work.
It will help those suffering from low blood pressure or laziness.
It is not advisable for patients with high blood pressure or heart disease.
You are ready to retain your breath after breathing out.
Breathe normally, smoothly and slowly emptying the lungs as far as possible, without straining.
Hold the breath as long as possible then inhale normally, continue for 10 minutes.
Pressures at the temple and a feeling of gasping in the abdomen indicate that you have crossed your limit.
Take a few deep breaths and do savasana.
This is good for relaxation and helps to reduce blood pressure.
He may pass through periods of hallucinations.
It brings about quietness of mind.
They are of three types - Jalandhara Bandha, Uddiyana Bandha and Moola Bandha.
They are used during internal retention after you have mastered the rhythm of breathing.
These two bandhas can be introduced when you are able to retain your breath for 10-15 seconds.
External retention can be combined with Uddiyana by a advanced students.
After external retention, one pulls in the abdomen (Uddiyana).
As stability is gained by practice we can reduce the number of normal breathing periods.
Remember while doing bandhas, do not to strain the neck.
Do not use force at any point.
Do not do external or internal retention with bandhas more than 6-8 cycles at a stretch.
It should be done once a day only and it is always better to seek training from a good yogi.
You will feel air entering the upper lobes of your lungs.
In many cases a lot of improvement can be achieved by breaking the habit of shallow breathing.
Keep your circles intact and fold three other fingers in the form of a half fist and put back on your knees or thigh facing down and start breathing the same way again, you will find your breath entering the middle lobes of your lungs.
Repeat the 15-second cycle 5 to10 times.
First, place your thumb across your palm so that the tips touch the base of the little finger.
Now close the four fingers over thumb to form a fist.
Place your fists on your thighs or knees facing downwards and repeat the breath cycle again.
you will feel air entering the lower lobes of your lungs.
There are 3 other Mudras which will help you to relax and while doing them you will feel peace and tranquillity riding over your mind.
Keep all other finger extended and keep again on knees or thighs but this time palm facing upwards.
Breathe normally, and now gradually slow it down.
Mudras of your hand are important and play a role in altering the breathing and giving a calming effect to your mind.
Here you bring the tips of your index fingers down to touch the middle joint of your thumbs.
Here the tips of your index fingers slide down further to the base of the thumb.
The hands are open and facing upwards.
Put your left hand down in your lap facing upwards.
Place your right hand on your left hand facing upwards.
This is a mudra for deep relaxation.
This mudra was used by Buddha and Mahabir for meditation.
In these Mudras you do not count seconds.
Do not hold in or hold out the air.
Just watch how your breathing continues, without any conscious manipulations.
You do them with palms facing downwards or upwards.
You can keep on changing the mudras of your hand as you go on doing the pranayama.
Mahabandha with PranayamaWhen doing Bandhas in Pranayama, special mudra of hands is useful.
Put your right thumb on your right palm and close with all fingers.
Same way do the left hand.
Place the hands on your lap touching the knuckles face to face and fists facing upwards.
This mudra is useful when pranayama is done with retention of the air inside or outside.
While retaining of air it must be done simultaneously with three safety valves.
The head should bend forward, the chin should be brought close to chest, the anus should be drawn in, the abdomen should be drawn in and should be continued till the retention continues.
This is also called Mahabandha.
If you find that you cannot do pranayama, may be you do not have suitable time or place or that it does not suit your temperament.
Do it sitting and keep your spine straight.
Never mind, you may try something else more vigorous, and for which you do not require a silent or secluded place.
It might agree with your temperament if it is more vigorous.
And that is swimming, more precisely, breast-stroke swimming.
While swimming, you will remember how breathless you have felt when you first started.
You had to hold the breath for a certain period and then gasp for breath.
The capacity to cope progressed as you practiced and became more experienced.
Swimming is one of the best forms of exercise, because you are buoyant and capable of moving all your limbs and body in every possible direction.
Swimming will help you not only as exercise but will have all the benefit of pranayama included.
You will lose weight if you are overweight and gain weight if you are underweight.
When it is functioning, it flattens out more and more, pressing the abdominal organs downwards and arching the abdomen outwards.
You can do it in Padmasana, Vajrasana, sitting cross legged or even sitting on a chair.
In upper breathing, it is the upper part of the lungs which fills up with air.
In middle breathing, only the middle and a bit of the upper parts are used.
In abdominal breathing the entire lower and middle parts are filled up with air, hence this is the best of the three.
The best type of breathing however would be when the upper, middle and the lower part of the lungs are filled up with air.
It is called pranayama breathing.
It puts the entire respiratory system into action, including every cell and muscle.
Many people breathe through their mouths, especially while speaking.
As a habit, many neglect to breathe through their nose while sleeping.
This habit has to be curbed.
Pay more attention to your ways of breathing.
Form a circle by touching the tips of your index finger and thumbs.
Be careful, and see how your child breathes.
If he acquires a right habit he will carry it throughout his life.
Many children breathe through their mouths.
Their growth will be stunted, and the thyroid will not function properly.
They will have problems of bad throat and tonsils.
Adenoid seems to be a cause for breathing through the mouth, but it is the other way round if we teach our children right breathing their adenoids can be controlled.
The nose has been equipped with all the defence devices.
The air we breathe is filtered by the hair in the nose to remove dust particles and small insects.
Further as the air passes the winding passage before it reaches the lungs, it is warmed, if too cold, and cooled if it is too warm, and so it is made more suitable.
Our breathing changes to avoid, as much as we can, of these toxic gases.
Do not put any pressure; otherwise the circle will become angular.
Adenoid helps us to fight the harmful bacteria and viruses which find their way along with the air we breathe.
Adenoids are useful, so do not be in a hurry to cut them off when you have tonsillitis because many a time the problem of a bad throat persist even after the tonsils are removed.
We have now realized that tonsils are useful and a part of our immunity system helping us to fight diseases.
In learning the right way of breathing we must proceed slowly and avoid overexerting ourselves.
Too much of anything is bad and this is also true if we are erratic or disordered during the practice of pranayama.
In deep inhalation we push down the diaphragm by expanding the lungs.
Expanding the abdomen has caused air to enter the lower part of our lungs.
To be sure you may place the palm of your hand on the abdomen to feel the movement.
Men will find that the first phase of yoga breathing is not difficult.
Women who have not participated in sports or done exercises will find it difficult.
Place the palms and fingers on your knee or thigh facing downwards.
But they will surmount their difficulty with patience and will power.
It will be interesting to note that the person who cannot do abdominal breathing has digestive problems, constipation and gynaecological disorders.
In the second phase we try to incorporate middle breathing.
We spread our lower ribs and the middle part of the chest so that little by little the air streams into the middle chest.
In the third phase we do full arching of the chest during inhalation.
You will realize that after full inhalation by arching the chest you can inhale further.
It will give support to the lungs and help the upper lungs to get filled up with air.
In practice we glide from one movement into another without interruption.
When seen from the side, yogi breathing will appear a wave like movement from the abdomen upwards.
While exhaling, do so in a slow rhythmic manner through the nose in the same sequence.
Now inhale your breath slowly and smoothly for five seconds, retain your breath for two seconds and exhale it for 7 seconds, and hold your breath for 1 second.
First we draw in the abdomen, press the lower ribs together and finally we lower the collar bone and shoulders.
While exhaling, we press the abdomen and lower ribs together to such a degree that very little air remains behind.
Practice this simplest form of pranayama morning and evening, preferably on an empty stomach.
Begin doing it one minute everyday and slowly increase the time up to five minutes.
Now you are ready to go in for deeper yoga breathing.
This breathing will help increase resistance to cold and cough, and it will help if you are suffering from bronchitis.
Develop a good healthy lung tissue to resist bacteria.
Boys and girls with an inferiority complex or a feeling of guilt tend to draw their shoulders forward pressing their chest together.
This is a bad habit and this awkward posture leads to less oxygen going to their lungs.
Such children with drawn shoulders are likely to have stunted growth and bad health.
Deep breathing allows more oxygen to enter the lungs.
You must have only undergarments or loose clothing.
Breathing is restricted by tight clothes, tight waist belts, tight trousers and the use of corsets to control our figure.
You should sit on the ground preferably covered by a blanket or cloth.
The body, head and neck should be erect and you should remain still with eyes closed.
Sit in padmasana or vajrasana if you can.
If you cannot sit in this way, sit in the sukhasan posture against a wall or adopt a comfortable posture keeping your spine straight.
If you are not in the habit of sitting on the floor or if you cannot sit, due to old age, bad knees, then sit on a straight chair, draw yourself into the back of the seat and keep yourself erect against the back rest of the chair.
The posture must be comfortable so that it may not be necessary to change the posture during practice.
The best time to practice pranayama is early morning.
It can be performed in the evening also.
When oxygen runs through the blood vessels, more oxygen will reach all our different organs of the body and improve their function.
Attend to your morning duties first, wash yourself and take a bath, if you can.
It should be done on an empty stomach or four hours after a meal.
Keep your mind calm and the mood must be cheerful and.
The practice of pranayama should not be a mechanical act.
The mind should be kept alert, the position and flow of breath should be watched from moment to moment.
You will acquire control over your breath gradually, although it takes time.
This is like the taming of a dog or the training of a tiger or an elephant by an expert trainer.
The sound of breath should be maintained uniformly.
During pranayam you feel a definite surge of energy and you will get a feeling of your mind calming down.
The body will be more relaxed after the pranayama is over.
The heart will be stronger and your child will become more alive and creative.
In pranayama there is an endless variety.
Here we would like you to practice one simple technique and master it.
If your breathing has gone on smoothly you can start proper Ujjayi pranayama.
Give a fractional pause after each expiration and inspiration.
Try to increase this pause slowly and smoothly.
Do not exert, do not suffocate yourself.
You will be able to hold your breath longer.
When you have retained your breath, feel the air reaching the remotest core of the lungs and percolating in your entire body.
If you feel tired switch on to normal breathing or you can go on alternating to normal breathing.
Respiration is the process by which human beings and other living things obtain and use oxygen.
During exercises also we get increased breathing and an increased supply of oxygen but it is consumed by the exercising muscles.
It also involves the elimination of carbon dioxide, a gas produced when cells use oxygen.
In external respiration or breathing, a plant or animal takes in oxygen from its environment and releases carbon dioxide.
When oxygen is carried to the cells of the organism and carbon dioxide is carried away it is called internal respiration within the cells.
The lungs in a human being are the chief organs of breathing.
They are elastic structures in the cavity and each contains millions of small air chambers or sacs.
Other structures important in breathing are the chest wall and the diaphragm.
The chest wall includes the ribs and the muscles between the ribs.
The diaphragm is a dome shaped sheet of muscle that separates the chest cavity from the abdomen.
Air enters and leaves the body through the nose and the mouth.
The pharynx (back of the nose and mouth), the larynx (voice box) and the trachea (windpipe) are the air passages that connect the nose and mouth with the lungs.
During yoga breathing however we store this extra energy and increase vitality.
During inspiration, also called inhalation, air from atmosphere is drawn into the lungs.
During expiration or exhalation, air is expelled from the lungs.
Death will occur if you do not breathe even for 3 minutes.
The pattern of breathing changes with certain diseases like asthma and bronchitis.
It also changes after a great physical activity when it becomes rapid and deep.
If we undergo a short exercise and run a few hundred yards our lungs become fresh and fit.
Several breathing exercises have evolved to ventilate our lungs for good health.
It pumps out the spent, toxic carbon dioxide gas.
Breathing has an intimate relation to our emotions.
When angry, excited, fearful, depressed, breathing takes a different pattern.
We are able to work longer hours without getting tired.
Though the pattern differs with different emotions, as far as we are concerned it is almost unconscious for we do not make any effort.
Proper breathing can be instrumental in toning up our physical and mental health.
It is voluntary and we have control over it.
We can change the way in which we breathe by making it deep or shallow and even stop it for a few moments at will.
It was well understood by sages and yogis who had mastered how to control it.
They came to the realization that if the pattern of breathing changed with emotions, we could master our emotions by changing the pattern of breathing.
This discovery was a real great boon and our Yogis worked on this idea for centuries.
Pranayama depends upon an intentional control over breathing which in turn controls our emotion.
This is the thread that links us to the realm of yoga, "pranayama and meditation".
While bathing in a river or a pool we try going under water and hold the breath as long as possible and compare it with others.
Mentally, we will be more alert and will keep ourselves calm and composed.
We hold our breath when we are submersed.
As we grow older and become engrossed with work and display signs of worry we seem to have less time to have this simple period.
He will hold his breath before serving the ball.
He does so because it gives him greater concentration and strength.
A good runner in a hundred yard dash completes his run often completely out of breath.
A javelin thrower or a discus thrower will hold the breath before the supreme exertion - greater will be his inhalation and longer he will hold his breath.
When you go under a cold shower on a winter morning, you hold your breath in the beginning of the shower to gather more strength to fight better the on-coming cold water.
When you contemplate a beautiful landscape and watch it for the first time, the breath stops in amazement and wonder for a few moments, struck by the scenic beauty.
You yawn, when tired and you are short of breath.
Looking at a great painting created by a master there is a feeling of vibrant sensation in the body, the mouth half opens, the breath stops for a few moments.
The pranayama should be done in a silent place; the air should be clean and pure.
This momentary stopping of breath, we call it Kumbhaka in pranayama.
It is the source of strength to our body and helps to control our emotions.
Breath is the bridge between the body, the senses and the mind.
Our aim is to strengthen this bridge.
For healthy living we have to build it and make it stronger and above all develop a harmony between body senses and the mind.
This has been the greatest challenge to our ancient sages.
They have tried to perfect breath control to suit occasions and there by master the emotions.
Today, more than ever before, this is making an impact as we try to get rid of the tension of an industrialized and materialistic world.
Modern medical science has come to the realization that pills are no answers for a hurried and worried world.
A lasting solution may be found in the 6,000-year old science of yoga.
An open space is preferable; or a garden, a park or a room with windows opened.
Their research on the effects of yoga, pranayama and meditation on the human body is proving positive.
They see a ray of hope in their fight to conquer the gravest riddle of tension-induced or psychosomatic, diseases.
The way we breathe is often inadequate, we breathe shallowly and lazily, so the blood is seldom, sufficiently oxygenated.
It is not sufficiently realized that several symptoms of poor health have their root cause in the fact that the circulation of blood is slow, it is insufficiently oxygenated.
It is then that the internal organs, glands and nerves are insufficiently nourished.
The excretory system does not function efficiently.
The body's waste products are not removed.
We are not aware of our shallow breathing as it does not put us immediately to any discomfort of breathlessness and it has already become a habit.
The cramped position many assume during their working hours, slumped in the executive chairs, typists bending down on their typewriters, clerks bending over their files, we compress our diaphragm lowering our lung capacity.
Our ribs and spine are so stiff that they do not allow the lungs to expand properly due to the limited space in the rib cage.
Hampered in this way we breathe in only an estimated one tenth of our oxygen requirement and use approximately 1/3rd of our lung capacity.
As this is the smallest part, only a little amount of air reaches the lungs.
This music is being developed for restless babies by a research organization.
Working in this way 2-3 hours, there cannot be any other way except "upper" breathing.
Lift your shoulders a little and breathe deeply.
Let your shoulder fall and throw back your head, and you will see that you can breathe in still more.
Now sit at a table, leaning over forward a bit, just as we do while working.
Breathing will be shallow as the shoulders are in an unnatural, high position.
It involves little of abdominal breathing.
The middle lungs are filled instead of the upper lungs.
This is the way most men breathe when they stand erect or sit in a crowded room, or cinema or.
We have to resort to hasty, short breathing.
The average civilized individual today is not breathing but merely avoiding suffocation.
Observe yourself, next time you are in a cinema.
This can be seen best in animals like a horse or dog which use thoracic breathing during exertion.
It is also practiced consciously by athletes.
Here the base of the lung is refilled with air, aided by the lowering of the diaphragm.
Most men breathe this way when lying down or resting.
It is the most efficient of the three ways of breathing but still inadequate.
The purest form of abdominal breathing is found in strong healthy men, soldiers, athletes, farmers and mountain shepherds.
The diaphragm plays an important role since it is a strong partition of muscles separating the chest and the abdomen.
At rest it arches upwards towards the thoracic cavity.
He found that persons who were well adjusted and had a settled, happy outlook on life were likely to hold out longer than those who did not possess this asset.
There is a belief among the superstitious that every one of us is born with a certain count of breaths.
You cannot avoid stress.
Like food, exercise or love, you have to have it.
But you must also be able to know the optimum stress level that you can bear.
Of course knowing this will help you to know when you are in the danger zone of stress-related diseases.
You must be firm to make adjustments to lessen your personal susceptibility.
Avoid getting overtired.
Ensure enough good quality sleep and develop the ability to say no and admit your limitations.
Women live longer than men.
Researchers have found out that they manifest less biochemical activity than men in response to stressful and challenging situations and also tend to unwind more quickly.
There is the case of a woman who worked until her 100th birthday and could see well enough to be able to read and watch television without glasses till her death at the age of 113.
When the number of these breaths is completed one has to leave this world.
Women students doing engineering have displayed hormonal stress reactions more similar to those of men than of those of women who followed a more traditional women's academic path.
Whether the new found liberation will prove detrimental and make them more prone to coronary heart diseases and ulcer is something that is being looked into.
When you have a very high ambition which you know you are incapable to achieve in your lifetime you are likely to be tense.
It will be a taxing period for you and the slow pace of your attempts of achieving your end will fill you up with frustration.
Divide your goals, keep targets which you can fulfil at shorter periods.
Every target you achieve will increase your strength and make you more confident.
A person who has confidence in himself is a relaxed person.
Noise pollution and population explosion tell on the nerves.
Jostling in crowded trains and buses, to and from your place of work, wheeling through frustrating traffic jams and imbibing exhaust fumes are a daily occurrence for millions of commuters.
According to an earlier research study in Bombay for the improvement of living and working conditions, it was found that 71 percent workers lived within 10 km of their work place.
By breathing 12-13 times, the count will be slow and you will go a long way.
About 22 percent travelled ten to 25 kms, seven percent had to travel more than 25 kms Some 75 percent workers took less than half an hour to get to work and 20 per cent over an hour.
In present-day Bombay, because of the influx of migrant labour and a big increase in population, at least 30% of the workers have to waste two hours each way travelling by train and bus to reach their working place.
Commuters at the end of the day complain of a far higher incidence of tiredness, irritability, lack of concentration, sleeplessness, headaches, digestive disorders, backaches, motion sickness and general discomfort.
If you breathe in heavily polluted air in a big and crowded township you will feel tensed.
If the pace of life is fast, and if we are running faster, tension will also go on mounting faster.
Tension keeps on filling the body.
Some day it may get filled to the brim Due to anxiety, our mind may work overtime in a state of violent tenseness and then it will target to stop thinking.
We go to bed, we feel tired, we feel drowsy but the mind goes on ticking.
We are not able to sleep.
We get up in the morning still tired, the mind does not seem to work properly.
It seems logical; if you breathe slowly and deeply, health will improve.
This in turn builds up more tension.
The body is tense, muscles become tense.
Neck muscles, shoulder muscles and the upper back get all tensed up.
If we put fingers on these muscles and try to probe them by pushing harder, we can feel that they are tense and tender.
This in turn shrinks the muscles.
Less blood flows through them and less blood reaches the neck and brain.
There is no inclination to smiling even if we try hard.
Then other problems crop up as the effect of tension spreads to several parts of the body.
Digestion suffers, the secretion of gastric juices appears to increase and the stomach may ache.
The heart seems to be jumping a lot, the pulse rate goes high, we become irritable.
With better health you are bound to cross all your limits.
There is loss of interest in the surroundings and there is loss of libido.
We must learn to relax in order to be able to reverse this negative process in the body.
We must try to tense and relax the muscles.
Dr. Steven J Schleiter of Mount Sinai School of Medicine U .S .A. says that the loss of the life partner is linked with increased illness and death, notably among the widowers.
His team of researchers found that there was a significant decline in the activity of the white blood cells which are responsible for the defence of the body in diseases.
Weakened resistance was aggravated by hormonal changes in the blood chemistry due to depression and anxiety which were common emotions among widowers.
Dr. Robert Ader, a British immunologist, showed through an experiment a clear and direct link between brain and the immune system.
He established that hypnosis can suppress allergic reactions.
These findings should alter a physician's approach to disease and also his attitude towards the patients.
If the physician talks to the patient trying to understand his problem, giving him a constructive suggestion, this may work far better than prescribing a tranquillizer.
This type of breathing raises only the ribs, top of the shoulders and the collar bone.
A split second prescription adversely affects doctor-patient interaction and hinders "meaningful" communication between the patient and his physician, according to some experimenters.
Leisure is not for all, it is meant for those who are busy mentally or physically.
Take a holiday at least once a year.
If there is no money, never mind, borrow, enjoy the holiday and pay later.
This is most prevalent in the west among the affluent or economically independent people.
They do not have to collect huge sums for their house, marriage of their daughters and for old age.
Children leave their homes early in life as they grow up.
They can buy a house or a car immediately as soon as they get a job and pay for it in instalments.
Our tradition of leisure is much older than that of the west, our religious and social set up is such that we are geared to taking several holidays.
Poets have written abundantly about pleasure to be derived from leisure.
The breath is introduced only in the upper part of the lungs.
They have written about the changing life during the 12 months of the year and have studied deeply the changes taking place in the nature during all the seasons.
Singers have developed ragas which are sung in different seasons.
They have also evolved ragas which are sung at different hours of the day.
Indian princes and noblemen have spent hours in the garden of their palaces watching dances and listening to music.
They woke up to the grandeur of the music of sahnai in the morning.
The kirtan and ajan of the mulla in sonorous Arabic words was meant to renew the body-soul.
Village folks walked around the well every morning singing while collecting the water.
Mothers have been singing to their babies throughout the ages, putting them to sleep.
Women folk sing while walking to the river to take their bath.
There tapes combine the relaxing music of Bach and Laurie Anderson with nature's own special sounds, the sort herd by unborn babies in the womb.
It has been noticed that adults also become much more calm and relaxed when the baby tapes are played.
The field of therapeutic sound is immense and offers exciting possibilities.
Mr. Olds of Runwell Hospital, Wickford, Essex, says that sound we hear in our sub-conscious has potentially a huge therapeutic effect.
Hear some soothing music for half an hour before you go to bed, you will sleep better.
Go back to nature and see how much it can make you feel relaxed.
Listen to your body when you are tensed up from long months of a routine existence.
When the body seems not to obey the mind, you feel tired and irritable.
This is the time for a holiday.
Come out of the rut of the daily routine.
Force yourself out of a dull environment.
When you come back from a week's holiday you will be rejuvenated.
The body and the mind will be more alert.
The spirit will be more alive and the speed of work much enhanced.
The ethos of the life philosophy, since ages, had been that our existence is not been given to us merely to earn money, to survive, on a physical plane.
Life is to live and to search for happiness for the body and the soul.
When I am tensed, I go for a long morning walk.
It is good to walk and walk till the body aches.
The mind gets busy with the aching muscles and it forgets its many worries.
Many people say that the benefit that they get after exercising is their improved psychological status.
They report less anxiety and depression.
There is more self confidence and ability to cope with at-home and job related stress.
It has been explained on a biological level that there is a decrease in circulating catecholamine's and increase in beta endorphins that occur during and following an exercise.
Even if we do not consider the change in blood chemistry it would be a good idea getting sedentary people up and away from chronic distress producing environment and help them to do their choicest exercise.
This happened when both the groups were kept on a healthy diet and at a normal weight.
This experiment has proved that there is definite evidence that heart diseases are induced by stress.
If this is true of monkeys, our pre-historic ancestors, it must be true of us.
Following an earthquake in 1981, in Athens, the incidence of fatal heart attacks rose sharply.
The heart stress connection is too powerful to be ignored.
A survey conducted by the Indian Council for Medical Research and the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuroscience showed that 22 percent of the screened population were suffering from mental disorders.
The severe emotional crisis of the people was due to conflict and guilt and not due to the nature of the disaster.
Later this caused a feeling of guilt in them for being those who were left behind and therefore they died.
Many found it difficult to adjust to bereavements, material loss and disability.
In a survey among 205 children of a school, 68 percent had difficulty in keeping up with the studies after the tragedy, 48 percent of them had been rendered unconscious by inhaling leaked methyl isocyanine gas.
An elderly woman from a colony adjacent to the Union Carbide factory could not speak or hear after the accident.
Yet physically there was nothing wrong with her.
Only after psychiatric help both her hearing and voice came back to normal.
Sometimes under stress, the morale of the people rises high, their cohesion and unity helps them to rise above their fears and overcome the extreme periods of distress most successfully.
During the Second World War, the people of Britain showed extreme sense of cohesiveness, according to psychologist Irving Janis.
The fear reaction subsided within 15 minutes after the end of the air raids.
People paid less attention to the sirens.
The citizens of Hiroshima also showed tremendous resilience, though the destruction, death injuries, illness caused by the tragedy was unprecedented.
The extent of the adverse effects was astonishingly small in intensity.
Within 3 months of the attack 140,000 people returned to the city.
Israeli sociologist Aaron Anthonovsky claims that 25 percent of those who survived the tortures of the concentration camps did so without succumbing to psychiatric disorders despite their long year's of physical suffering under constant fear of death and terrible atrocities.
The unity, the moral support to each other, the great social admiration turned them into heroes.
They could all join together to fight their common fear and the enemy.
A weak politician in the face of scarcity, of general grievances, upheaval and fears of disintegration is known to exercise control over everything by waging war against the enemy.
In a medical college in 1959, in Kanpur, one day in the early hours of the morning, we were taken to the Central Jail, to witness a hanging.
Three brothers had wiped out a whole family in a land dispute.
One was given imprisonment for life and the other two were to be hanged that morning.
It was dawn and we were standing at some distance from the hanging area.
We saw the two condemned brothers coming with policemen.
One of them was walking straight and looked fearless.
The other was not able to walk.
His legs were trembling and he was full of fear.
He was being supported by two policemen.
They were brought to the hanging platform the first person stood in the spot where he was told to.
The second accused was begging to be pardoned.
Hindus believe that if you call God's names just before death, you will go to heaven.
Black covers were put on their heads and the loop, were put round their necks.
Moments later, the hangman pulled the handle and both the brothers were swinging by their necks over the ditch below.
There was not even a tremor in their bodies.
Of course, the hangman did not warn them before he pulled the handle.
Both brothers had committed the same crime and had the same punishment.
But one remained strong and ready to face the end, the other got weak in the face of death.
One's own temperament is important in the face of severe stress.
Others may crumble under much milder stress.
A number of interviews were conducted with the survivors of the Nazi concentration camps to determine how they had been able to survive and cope with stress.
A few of them told an investigator that they survived for a purpose: to help a relative, to bear witness and show the world what happened to them or to seek revenge.
Some inmates focused their attention to small gratifications such as getting through the food line.
Humour also plays a great role in the survival process and there are a few who can keep up humour in the most difficult circumstances.
A man in front of a firing squad was asked, if he would like a last cigarette, he refused saying, "No thanks, I am trying to give up smoking".
Both laughter and tears seem to release stress.
Bulman and Camille interviewed 29 people suffering from paralysis caused by different types of automobile accidents, or a fall or by injury in the football field.
A few were coping better than others.
The fellows who were doing well were those who accepted reality and tried to deal with it positively.
Others were coping poorly, particularly those who denied to themselves the knowledge, the extent of the injury and expected to get well miraculously.
Some thought that it was their fate, felt helpless and were unable to develop a control over the future.
Patients who felt responsible for their injury also felt responsible for their recovery and were coping better.
Some 26 percent of rape victims did not feel that they had recovered from assault even after four to six years after.
Studies concerning widows revealed that 25 per cent of them felt sufficiently distressed in the first two years after the death of their husbands.
In another study 40 percent of the bereaved continued to experience anxiety even after two to four years after the loss of their loved ones.
Vietnam combat veterans had a high rate of mild to severe depression and anxiety.
In "Death and Dying" that an individual must face death by going through a sequence of reactions like denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.
When there is a constant fear of terrorist attacks or war or uncertainty of political and social upheaval, there may be a need for denial in order to feel better and maintain hope and a sense of self-worth.
Denial dampens the idea and feeling and allows an individual to adjust gradually to unpleasant circumstances.
A weak and helpless victim of polio, burns, or spinal cord injury often uses denial at first in order to cope with stress in the early stage.
Later they begin to rehabilitate and shift to direct means of coping with stress.
It can be destructive at times, when women deny the significance of lumps in their breasts, or men experiencing heart attack deny the significance of pain.
When we want to release tension, we prefer to go to a serene, calm and secluded place, a sleepy atmosphere where there is no rush.
Noise, high living, the rush on the roads and pollution add to tension.
This is what happened to an isolated village, in the Swiss Alps, called Saas, which was a sleepy, calm region.
A road was opened and overnight it became a tourist resort, in 1957
By 1970, over 250,000 winter tourists and 500,000 summer tourists were invading this once secluded area.
Now it has a 10-month long tourist season.
The local people worked long hours each day, seven days a week.
As the economy developed, major changes started taking place in this remote village.
In the last 20 years of boom, the family ties have weakened.
Parental involvement in raising children has become less and less.
Some of the pernicious habits of the visitors have been adopted.
The use of alcohol and drugs has increased.
The gap between older and younger generation is widening.
This rapid social change has taken its toll among adults, leading to cases of chronic fatigue, irritability, insomnia, ulcers and high blood pressure.
Alcoholism is increasing among the young and women.
Divorces and mental illnesses are the rule of the day.
The affluent countries of the West are the greatest sufferers of tension.
Westerners who were learning yoga invariably said that yoga gave them peace of mind.
The most powerful man of a most powerful country of the world whose finger controls the nuclear button fares better than his deputy.
He is a more successful man.
Success Promotes longevity, gives you something to live for.
Middle managers are more stressful, they are the persons who are trying hard but still do not reach the executive summit.
William Sergeant, a celebrated U .K. Psychiatrist, recognized that the ability to cope with various stressful situations varied from person to person according to their temperament.
Everyone needs rest and sleep but the amount required differs for each individual.
Most adults require about 7 to 8 1/2 hours at night.
Everyone often has trouble getting sleep.
Insomnia indicates physical or emotional disorders.
Rest and relaxation are as important as sleep.
After strenuous work, a person may need a period of rest and during others he may just require some relaxation or a change of place.
Pleasurable and relaxing activities help the body to shed tension and remain robust.
If rest and relaxation do not relieve fatigue and tension, the individual may have a physical or emotional problem.
Exercise helps to keep the body healthy and fit.
Vigorous exercise strengthens the muscles and improves the function of the circulatory and respiratory systems.
To achieve fitness, a person should start an exercise program slowly and build it up gradually to a level that maintains a healthy heart and strong muscles.
Daily exercise provides the greatest benefits.
Health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being.
It involves more than just the absence of disease.
A person who is in good physical condition has the strength and energy to enjoy an active life and withstand the stresses of daily life.
Proper nutrition, exercise, rest and sleep, cleanliness and medical and dental care are essential parts of hygiene.
Handling stress is essential for avoiding both mental and physical illness.
No one can avoid stress but a person can do a few things to help lessen the danger of becoming ill due to stress.
Regular exercise and sufficient sleep strengthen the body's resistance to stress.
Everyone should learn to relax by resting, taking a walk, meditating, indulging in a hobby or by any other method that is found successful.
Stress is the spice of life.
Without stress, life would be dull and boring.
When you are tense your speed increases, your reaction time becomes shorter, you are able to finish your work with a time bound precision.
Your job will be a challenging one.
It is when you fix goals.
To reach them in time, strive hard.
With every goal achieved you become stronger and you are able to reach higher targets.
A nagging wife is a good wife because she keeps you tense and compels you to finish important works in time.
Tension is good for students to keep themselves on their toes.
They strive to do their homework and study properly and secure good marks.
When a nagging wife starts nagging for little things, all the time, and does not let you live in peace in your own house, or when a student is goaded by his parents to reach a higher ambition or to get distinction marks, that is when you have tension.
This is more so in the case of a student who is not very bright and in fact not capable of achieving much in studies.
If you set high targets, which are not within your ability or something that may take a lifetime to complete and you are still not sure whether you will be able to cope with them, your tension increases.
Tension keeps building up.
It is like your bank account, if you are lucky, you keep on depositing money.
Slowly, steadily and gradually it swells into a big account, when you will be able to buy a car, a scooter, a fridge or TV or build a house.
Tension keeps on mounting in the same way gradually and steadily if you are not able to find solutions to your problems.
It gets deposited slowly and gradually in your account.
You are aware of your bank account building up, but may not be conscious about your tension building up in the body.
There is no accurate measuring scale to know how much exactly your tension account is and how much has been deposited in your body bank.
A small tension is spice, but too much tension becomes poison for your existence.
Some amount of stress for a small duration does not harm the body, the changes which come in the body during stress, return to normal when it is over.
In other words ambitious persons, who have no perspective of their own limitations, believe they can do it all.
If they fail to achieve their desired goal, they refuse to settle for the second best.
We call this nervous tension.
It can create havoc in the body.
Tension is a part of our modern living.
It is a product of industrialization and materialism.
This has already come in a big way in Western countries.
As the speed of life increases, it builds tension with an equal speed.
As the struggle for existence increases, so does tension.
When you find it difficult to get a job, or set up a business, when there is difficulty in getting a house, or admission for your children in a school, there is a cause to become tense.
You exhaust yourself in collecting the basic necessities of life.
This plight goes on all the time even during an emotional adjustment with your family members.
This comes also in competitions with your relatives, friends and your neighbours.
Trying to keep up with the Joneses, you tend to show off what you are not and crave for appreciation and prove yourself bigger than what you actually are.
All these are capable of generating unhealthy tension.
Let us go back 30,000 years, to the times of our ancestors.
They lived and struggled for food and shelter.
Entering a forest clearing, if a hunter suddenly comes face to face with a ferocious and hungry tiger looking for its prey, confrontation takes place, their eyes meet.
The body becomes tense, the man feels the accelerated pounding of his heart, blood pressure rises, the mouth becomes dry, sweat appears on his brow.
Breathing hard and thinking fast, the man has to make a decision.
Stand and face the animal and fight to death, or turn around and run into the thickets.
Evolution has equipped us to react to a stressful situation physically.
As the body receives stress signals, the concerned nerves begin their work to stimulate the pituitary gland.
This is the master key gland which in turn stimulates other glands to secrete a hormone called adrenaline.
This is a substance which excites all the body systems.
With a racing heart and fast breathing, more oxygen is pumped into the blood, raising blood pressure and pulse pressure.
With a shaky stomach the man is ready to fight or run.
If the stress subsides, these responses die away.
The body is released from tension and returns to a state of equilibrium thus an athlete after his event comes back to a normal state.
His body reaction subsides and no harm is done to the body.
Same thing happens to a student who has to undergo an examination.
It is then that the body does not come back to the post-stress normal physiological state.
This is the time which is fraught with danger.
Now when we are not obliged to fight or flee we may get palpitation, sitting at our desk.
A constant panic turns itself into a situation which gives rise to clammy hands, racing pulse, high blood pressure, stomach hyper secretion, and a nervous system that goes hay-wire.
Instead of improving the performance under stress, we reach a point where greater pressure is actually counterproductive and can result in physical breakdown.
We may then feel restless, tense, irritable or depressed.
We may suffer from loss of appetite, insomnia, extensive fatigue and a loss of sexual potency.
During the 1970s there was considerable research into the relationship between stress and disease particularly regarding stress and cancer, heart disease, diabetes, peptic ulcer, tuberculosis, eczema and asthma.
Headaches caused by tension affect an estimated 15 million Americans, while high blood pressure affects 20 million.
A lady was suffering from diarrhoea, but neither medicine nor a change in the diet could help her.
Ultimately, she was cured by a psychoanalyst.
A problem so obscure, so remote, so different can be due to tension.
The modern medical world agrees that the mind or in-built tension can play a dominant role in all diseases and a major role in 60 percent of all diseases.
To live in this world facing all challenges, hearing all misfortunes, and to overcome the prevalent greed and jealousy you need to be relaxed and have a clear mind.
Greed and jealousy are the root causes of all mental and physical diseases.
See to it that they do not enter your mind.
Forty years ago people were dying of cholera, small pox and plague.
More people are dying of heart attack, blood pressure, cancer, and diabetes.
It is the price we pay for the so-called progress, industrialization and for getting more affluent.
The Atherosclerosis Research Centre in the U .S .A. tried an experiment to find out how stress could induce heart attacks.
They took two groups of animals and fed them low fat and low cholesterol diet and matched them for their body weight and blood pressure reading.
For one group they made living very stressful by putting them in cages to break up their normal sort of way.
At the end of the experiment, 21 months later, it was found that the stressful group was suffering from serious signs of fatty deposits in their arteries.
Not long ago a patient came to me filled with mental distress.
He had not been able to sleep well for years.
He was irritable, had a bad tummy upset, and an irritation of the throat and chest.
The law suits were being fought in the courts of law and there was no end in sight.
With cordiality gone and hatred mounting, the effect of all this started descending from a mental to physical level.
I advised him to go home, withdraw or lose, but end all the pending court matters and then come back to me.
To my surprise he did as advised.
In a few weeks he was bouncing with joy both physically and mentally.
He had become a new man.
He had zest for life.
The ability to let off steam or relieve tension now and again seems to help.
We can express our feelings and unwind ourselves in many different ways, share our feelings with those whom we know and trust.
Having the capacity to laugh at ourselves now and then allows us to relax.
Screaming and yelling will also help though it may not be socially acceptable.
The fear of a nuclear holocaust has been keeping Americans and Europeans tense.
The collection of a nuclear arsenal enough to finish the world a hundred times is adding to people's anxiety and their tension.
A nuclear war in Europe, it is estimated, will wipe out instantly some 150 million people.
Half the survivors would have permanent injuries.
A nuclear physicist, Mr. Joseph Hotblat, told a conference of world doctors and medical scientists from 30 countries, in Cambridge, that a nuclear holocaust will so contaminate the atmosphere that it will be totally dark even during the day.
Survivors would die of starvation as farming would prove impossible.
Love and compassion of your wife, your children, your relatives, your friends are important in that they can fill you up and relieve you from tension.
In a study it was found that women who shared an intimate relationship with her lover or husband were 90 percent less likely to become depressed than women who had no such relationship to turn to.
Workers sent out of their jobs are less likely to become depressed or ill if they had supportive marital relationship.
A proper relationship based on love and friendship can be a great outlet for easing pent-up feelings.
Children who are fed with mother's milk grow in a much more psychologically stable environment than children fed with bottle milk.
Most likely, this is due to the fact that apart from good quality milk, the love that a mother imparts to her child by holding it close to her breasts in an affectionate hug is something that makes all the difference.
The special position that the child's spine takes when held in the mother's lap helps it to grow in a normal way.
Auto-suggestion can help relieve tension.
A strong suggestion, or faith, or belief, in oneself can help you come out of tension.
If you can strongly suggest to a person and build his confidence it will help him to come out of his problem.
A strong mind can overpower a weak mind and help it to relax and can give constructive help.
Psychotherapy and hypnotism are based on this principle.
Tabeej provided by faqirs, black threads offered by sadhus, metallic rings from tantrics and astrologers, are supposed to give help.
Through suggestion the wearer feels secure and more confident that he can override misfortunes.
Once, a person asked Gandhi how to get rid of tension.
Gandhi suggested to him to recite Ram nam (God's name).
Faith in God can help people to come out of their misery.
If you can recite God's name with faith and confidence it will help you.
If you strongly feel that he will protect you, you will feel his hand of protection.
Faith plays a major role.
We work for a reward.
We help others with a hope to get help in our own needs.
When it is not coming we get frustrated.
The message of the Gita will greatly help people who indulge in meaningless competitions and frustration.
The therapeutic package for problems and anxiety is based on the principle of "Nishkam-karma" (work without expecting rewards).
This has helped people to function effectively in an achievement oriented world where reward might not always be certain.
The system of concentration and meditation practiced by the yogis of India may well be the answer to complaints that the medical science has not been able to help.
A sensitive machine called biofeedback has been invented not long back to help people to learn relaxation.
It interprets and translates into a screen the state of relaxation of the body.
As we relax the sound waves becomes milder indicating that we are heading in the right direction.
This helps us to become acquainted with the ways of relaxation.
Later when we have mastered the technique, we can discard the machine and carry on with the relaxation exercise.
British doctors in colonial India sent reports around that yoga masters would perform amazing feats like stopping heart beats, and walking on burning embers with no apparent injury.
The reason was that the yogis had obtained extraordinary control over their bodies especially the autonomic nervous system which operates without conscious control.
The heart beat lessens by an estimated 5 beats per minute.
Evidence has also been gathered that the blood pressure can be controlled by meditation.
Though less clear-cut, it has a beneficial, direct physiological effect on the heart.
Meditation is most beneficial for those who are prone to coronary ailments.
We can learn the technique to relax the mind and the body whenever we desire.
At moments of stress, we should lock ourselves in a quiet room for about half an hour; allow the mind and body to take control of the proceedings.
You come out of it quite relaxed.
Meditation is an effective weapon in our artillery.
We should use it whenever we are under great stress.
Meditation can help in many ways, even to lessen the incidence of crime.
It was experimented in a crime-ridden village of Bhusandpur in Puri district, Orissa.
To verify this claim made by Mr Prasanna Patsani, MLA, a group of newsmen from Bhubaneshwar descended to this Orissa's biggest village which is surrounded by undulating hills, overlooking the Chilka lake.
Patsani, a bearded, saffron robed Naxal turned Congress (I) leader, took the press party to the two acre walled compound of the village temple where classes were being held.
They were asked to do asanas followed by pranayama and dhyana (meditation) to the accompaniment of vedichymns taped in a cassette.
Mr Patsani admits they are paid Rs 50 each per month as compensation for their lost working hours since 90 percent of the villagers live by fishing on the Chilka.
But that is not the only reason why they are enthusiastic.
They have found out the physical and mental benefits of the exercise in the open.
Savasana (the corpse poses) is a powerful asana for relaxation which was extensively advocated by the late cardiologist Dr K .K. Datey.
He firmly believed that relaxation played an important role in helping to cure heart diseases and lowering high blood pressure.
The simplest thing to do is to select a quiet place with clean air, free from insects and unpleasant smell.
Spread a blanket or sheet on the ground or a wooden plank.
Remove the hoes, loosen the belt, remove glasses or have only light clothing.
When you lie on a hard surface, without a pillow, your spine is straight, almost touching the floor all through.
This is the most relaxed position for the body.
If you feel that your spine is not touching the floor, bend both knees, see that it touches the floor, and stretch your legs apart.
Stretch out both your arms, resting them by your side, forming an angle of 15-20 degrees at the arm pit, feet slightly apart and let them fall outwards evenly, eyes gently closed.
When the whole body is relaxed, you feel it all gone, heavy and sinking to the floor.
You feel as if you are partially paralysed and even if you try, you will not be able to lift your leg or arms.
Stay in this bodily state as long as you can.
Pay much attention to your breath; let it flow smoothly and deeply.
Remain in this position for 10-15 minutes.
You can picture some pleasant thoughts or you may make your mind feel vacant or empty; enjoy the state of light sleep.
It is a state of deep rest and peace which brings us perfect health.
When you are ready to get up, say to yourself that you are completely relaxed.
You are there ready to wake up.
Bend your right knee and then the left knee, bend your right arm and then the left arm Open up your body, as it were, stretch the arms above head, stretch the legs and all of your body.
Sit down for a few moments and you are ready to start your next routine.
If you have difficulty in getting sleep, try the following method.
It is more important, that in the first place if your mind is calm, you can relax anywhere, even in your office, the aircraft, in the bus or train.
Make yourself comfortable whether sitting or reclining.
Raise your chin and then let it fall.
Take a few deep breaths; see that your mind is calm and tranquil.
Imagine that you are sitting on a rock or on a sea beach or even in a garden with a lot of flowers, try to picture any place or situation you have enjoyed the most.
See in your mind's eye the different colours of the flowers, watch their freshness, smell the soft smell flowing from them, feel the cool breeze flowing over your body.
Imagine a place you have visited in the past and which represent, to you an ideal spot for physical and mental relaxation.
Children can also be tense and it affects their health.
Many children therefore suffer from peptic ulcers and heart diseases.
A report from Tokyo prints out those pressures to do well in school have led to a rapid rise in stomach ulcers among the elementary and middle school children.
Remember, the seeds of future heart attacks are laid in childhood.
If you find that your child is not relaxed, if he is not able to sleep well due to tension, you may recommend to him a very simple exercise for relaxation.
For instance let him lie down comfortably in bed.
Switch the light off, close the door to cut down the noise, if necessary.
Ask him to imagine that he has got holes in the soles of his feet.
Let him imagine breathing in and out through these holes.
Let him imagine that fresh cool air is entering from his sole and passing through his feet, thighs, waist and reaching the chest.
In the same way while breathing out let him imagine that the air is passing down his waist, his thighs, feet and through the imaginary holes in his feet.
Let him do this exercise for 5-10 minutes.
He will feel thoroughly relaxed with exercise and will sleep much better.
Relaxation can be achieved through a steam bath, sauna bath warm bath and the various cold water applications, which we have already mentioned in detail in the chapter on water treatment.
Massage can also be very relaxing.
Any treatment which relaxes the muscles and the body physically will relax the mind also.
If we relax our muscles, this cycle of mind tension, tensing our muscles can be broken.
When our muscles are relaxed our mind is also relaxed.
That massaging, when done with strong hands and with strong pressure will be more beneficial is not true.
For relaxation, the massage should be done with soft hands and it should be soothing and pleasant.
It can be done with your hands if help is not available, it can be done by your life partner, a friend or a relation.
It is not the pressure but the awareness of your body which helps you to relax deeper.
It should be done systematically from the toes to the head.
It should be done with a certain rhythm and always from the periphery towards the heart.
A doctor recently has been experimenting on this same principle and helping patients of tension headaches and peptic ulcers by asking them to concentrate on their hands and feel them getting warmer.
This technique takes time to be learnt.
This occurs as blood rushes to the palm, and as a result the head or the abdomen gets rid of the excessive blood.
They are generally sensitive to such irritants as dust pollens and fumes, but a lot of their trouble stems from nervous tension.
An asthmatic patient is treated in a soundproof room and wired to a Biofeedback machine.
If he is relaxed, he only hears a slow clicking.
He is then asked to visualize dust, flowers or whatever that possibly causes asthmatic attacks.
Usually he grows tense at the very thought of these items.
The patient is aware that he is on the verge of a full scale attack.
When he learns that tension is his enemy, he can learn to control it by listening to the clicks and by trying to slow them down.
Biofeedback helps to master the technique of self-relaxation.
Later the patient can dispense with the machine altogether.
By then he would have learnt to relax and by his own efforts be able to lead a fuller and happier life.
Women who work and live together with men folk get their menstrual cycle synchronized.
An architect friend stresses the fact that design and even the colour of the home have an effect on the mind.
Houses can be designed in a way that the resident feels mentally peaceful.
There is also a theory that haunted houses are nothing but badly designed houses which have a horrible, ghastly effect on the mind.
According to a study, Children growing up in flats in skyscrapers have more mental problems.
Playing and running on the ground, living nearer to the earth as it were has a beneficial psychological effect.
Live in a bungalow if you can afford it, but a hut will be equally relaxing.
Let your children be in constant contact with mother earth.
People living in a combined family seem to be emotionally more stable.
Children growing in their grandparents laps get mutual affection and time.
Thus the individuals get more support in moments of emotional crisis.
Because of the last war, the British have suffered a lot in terms of parental love and family life.
The result of this poll came as a massive backlash to the type of permissive society seemed to have evolved with marriage considered outdated.
Free love and taking drugs were fashionable.
The Britons, today, are against a world of permissiveness, or single parent families and quick divorces.
The traditional family has won a massive vote of confidence with special emphasis on the need for children to be brought up by both parents.
This poll was conducted among 1500 adults aged 15 plus.
In India, we are better off.
The combined Family is still a tradition with us and permissiveness a few steps away.
How long we will be safe is yet to be ascertained as foreign habits, ways, customs and the style of living are flowing faster into this side of the world.
Meditation techniques vary but essentially they are all the same because their final objective is to help to develop and exploit inner awareness.
In a way, through meditation, you become more aware of your body and the outside world.
You are able to think better in whatever type of work you do.
You become more efficient, your body healthier.
Meditation should be done in a calm, comfortable environment.
Focus your mind on mantras or breathe.
Transcendental meditation is helped by a mantra, a word or sound or command from your instructor.
The technique is simple, faster to learn and gives coolness to mind and gets you into a state of deep relaxation.
Vippassana meditation does not take the help of any mantra.
It takes the help of breath.
This is supposed to be the oldest form and was used by Lord Buddha to attain Nirvana.
It is more valuable in curing diseases, apart from giving physical and mental relaxation.
It cleanses the body like fasting or dieting.
In his book "Your Healthy Heart" he recommends meditation to heart patients.
He furthers says that, during meditation, the cardiac output decreases by 25 percent as in sleep.
Most people who mind what they eat and do regular exercises, still have an urge to go 'off the wagon', and feast on a candy or a cake.
Everyone needs fun food, occasionally.
A diet should be such that it could be followed for the rest of one's life.
If a balance is maintained between eating nutritious food, exercising, and a fun food when the urge is great, you will be on the right track.
These claims are the greatest frauds perpetrated on unwary people.
They go to the extent of calling dieting and exercising gimmicks.
Body wraps have no effect on the body fat.
They will not dissolve it.
Although they will cause profuse perspiration, the weight loss effect is temporary says the Food and Drug Administration of the United States.
FDA further says that a rapid and excessive fluid loss caused by these wraps can be dangerous.
Making a quick buck at the cost of health can be a dangerous business.
The appetite suppressants (Amphetamines) have hardly any value in the treatment.
They may have an effect only during the period they are used.
They do have side effects.
Obesity is a lifelong problem so these drugs are hardly of any value.
The Thyroid hormones are used to increase the oxygen consumption of the body.
The weight loss is mainly due to loss of lean mass rather than the fat tissue.
Cosmetic surgery like liposuction, where fat is literally sucked out, or through excision can have a surgical risk.
The effect again is not permanent.
In course of time the remaining fat cells divide and again form the fat mass.
We must take a lifelong treatment, making exercise a habit and avoiding fat and sugar as far as one can dispense with them.
Start with an all fruit diet for 5,7or 10 days.
Do it according to your capacity and see how you feel.

Take fruit juices, skimmed milk, butter milk, barley water, they carry fewer calories.
You need not avoid rice or potato.
You can have them every day if you want to, but boiled.
Roasting vegetables in the oven is better.
Vegetables are tastier with the peel on.
After roasting, the peel can be removed.

For roasting you may prefer potatoes, brinjal, tomatoes, parwal, ladies fingers or even tinda.
The salad may be prepared in many ways using cucumber, cabbage, tomato, carrots, radish, onions, beet root, spinach, simla mirch etc.
You may prefer one big salad meal like the ones now being served in restaurants in a hundred ways.
Walking is the best exercise.
Walk every morning till you feel tired.
You can cover almost 6 kms in one hour.
If you are young and strong do jogging.
Swimming is excellent.
Play a vigorous game like badminton, squash or tennis.
It is easier to play than walk or exercise.

It will help to perspire vigorously.
Do not try to reduce your weight fast.
You may feel weak, giddy or may develop chest pain.

Do Pranayama, it will help to relax, ventilate your lungs and help vital organs to function better.
Find out the best relaxation technique for your needs.
Do meditation: it lessens tension and reduces the craving for food.
They are secreted in the liver in a larger quantity.
They are responsible for high blood pressure among the fat people.
Generally people who are fat consume more food and along with it more salt.
Salt helps to retain water in the body, causing a rise in blood pressure.
Generally these people consume up to 12gms of salt.
It is better we take 3-5gms of salt per day.
Most of the obese also get diabetes.
80% of all adult obese are diabetic in the US.
If you have been obese for a long time you have more chances of getting diabetes.
They usually have less glucose tolerance.
A small amount of sugar tends to raise their blood sugar level.
They become resistant to insulin.
Luckily, the process is reversible when the weight is reduced.
The obese tend to have a big tummy and so there is a constant on the spine.
This causes a low back pain and early arthritis of the spine.
Heavy body weight puts a strain on the knees as they have to bear the brunt of the weight.
Knee arthritis is common among the obese.
Generally they have a high level of uric acid in the blood.
High blood pressure and diabetes cause complications during pregnancy.
There will be a prolonged labour when the size of the baby is big.
Many of these cases will have to be submitted to a caesarean operation.
Tumours and cancer of the uterus are more common among the old.
Fat people have more problems with their tummies.
Flatulence, bloating, dyspepsia, and diaphragmatic hernia are common.
Their liver functions less efficiently.
They have more skin infections due to a moist skin fold, more common in the groin, arm pits and under the breast.
They are at a higher surgical risk.
Anaesthesia is more dangerous, the time taken for an operation is longer, and wounds take longer to heal.
The treatment depends mostly on reducing the food intake, increasing exercises or both.
For lifelong obesity, exercise and dieting both should be combined.
What food you take really is not important.
The calorie is a calorie regardless of its source.
We should be only careful that the diet is balanced so that it does not make us ill in the long run.
A high carbohydrate diet will bring a slower reduction in obesity because with a high carbohydrate diet, there is a tendency to take in more salt.
More salt helps retain extra water in the body.
A high protein diet helps to excrete water faster.
But in the long run it brings ketosis and acidosis.
Eating food frequently helps to remain less fat.
If you eat less frequently you tend to eat a bigger quantity and the food tends to be more unbalanced.
Obesity is more common in people who eat less frequently.
Fasting is done for a quick weight reduction.
Preferably, there should be short fasts lasting not more than a week or ten days.
Long term fasts by the obese may cause anaemia, potassium depletion, ketosis, liver dysfunction and hypotension.
Judicious fasting will give you health but it should be done under proper guidance.
There are three fundamental methods for reducing weight: fasting, dieting and exercising.
It is always better to combine two of them rather than to depend on one alone.
Fasting and exercise if combined can bring about a fast reduction in weight.
This should however be done under a good health farming expert.
In the beginning the reduction is at a rapid rate.
This is due to the loss in the content of the intestines and loss of water due to salt restriction.
This initial quick reduction in weight creates an illusion among the obese patients.
This lost weight will be regained faster, when they resume their normal diet.
The real reduction takes place when the fat is shed.
It is brought about when the fat calories are used by the body instead of calories supplied by customary food.
Chemically pure fat has a fuel value of 4,000 calories per pound.
The fuel value of the body fat is 3,000 calories per pound as it contains 25% of moisture.
So a person whose size and activity requires 3,000 calories a day will lose 1lb. a day.
A person whose calorie requirement is 2,000 calories will lose of 2/3lb. a day.
The actual weight lost is a little more than the figures above as some non-fatty tissue is also lost, though slowly.
When you do a complete fast, the muscles, blood, liver and other vital parts also decrease in weight.
An average man taking moderate exercise and fasting can lose one pound a day and a woman, a pound a day.
There are over 15 regimen diets, which are popular among the Americans.
The ideal diet should take into consideration the vitamin and mineral requirement of the body.
it should be able to draw calories 15% from proteins,30% from fats and 55% from carbohydrates.
There are quite a few fat diets in the US based on bestselling books F-plan, Atkins, Pritikins and Scarsdale.
It is difficult to decide which one is the best to supply all nutrients essential for the body.
It will depend on the individual.
F-plan includes Low fat, high in complex carbohydrates (whole grains and beans) and enough supply of vitamins.
Dr Denis Burkitt, an English physician, limits fat and reduces protein, raising the intake of fibre-rich fruits, vegetables and whole grain cereals.
The Beverly Hill is basically a low protein diet for first 9 days, all the food taken is by way of fruits.
Then, gradually carbohydrates, fats and proteins are added.
The pritikins Diet is high in fibres, to promote a good bowel movement.
It contains so little fat that it may not taste good and may be difficult to swallow.
High fibre food is most important in all weight reducing diets.
You chew it more; you take a longer time to eat.
Food is bulky, leaves you more satisfied, and it leaves little space for refined foods made with the help of sugars and oils.
You feel less tempted and have much less appetite for different snacks and fats.
One experiment has proved that when you eat rapidly you become hungry faster than when you eat precisely the same size of meal at a slower rate.
Rich fibre food holds extra water, so one extra litre of water retained will help to increase the transit time or the time taken by the food through the body and thus will relieve constipation.
With a high fibre diet you excrete more calories in the stool.
Tests indicate that the calorie content of the faeces amount is nearly ten percent when people are on a high fibre diet.
So it is worth following the advice to chew your food as many times as the number of your teeth before you swallow.
So for good health and a slim body chew, chew and chew till you can drink your solid foods and eat your liquids.
Lachance, a leading nutritionist, cautions against liquid protein diet.
It may cause cardiac irregularities.
He claimed that the health of Americans would improve if they simply ate more complex carbohydrates and less fat.
Mote fat is associated with colon cancer.
It will be a great improvement in the diet of those who feast on 50% plant food and 50% animal food.
Lachance says you can eat all types of food and still lose weight if you are willing to exercise.
A lady sought a doctor for a prescription of Amphetamine (a drug which causes loss of appetite).
The doctor took out his prescription pad and scribbled multivitamin tablets and handed it to her.
He told her if she walked briskly 2 miles every day she would have no more troubles with her weight.
It worked and she lost a lot of weight.
She should not miss a single day's exercise.
Exercise tones up the muscles, reduces appetite and improves the psychological outlook on life.
Breakfast is important for health conscious people.
You are better off eating just a good solid breakfast chiefly cereals, than gorging yourself on a big dinner or lunch.
The old fashioned belief that an imbalance between eating and physical exercise was the main cause for fat to develop is extremely sound.
The less you eat and more you exercise, the less fat you will have.
Obesity can lead to several medical problems including emotional and social.
Fat people are treated unkindly by others, particularly by classmates in the school.
If you eat more calories than you use, they will turn into body fat.
If you eat 3,000 calories more than what the body needs, you will gain one pound in weight.
People who are overweight, of normal weight, or underweight may all eat the same kinds of food.
Their weight difference results from the amount of food they eat in relation to the amount of energy they use.
Physical inactivity can lead to obesity among all age groups especially among children and teenagers who are the most active groups.
Most obese young people do not eat more than those of normal weight.
In fact, most of them eat less.
But they are so inactive that even with moderate appetite they eat more than they need and accumulate excessive fat.
Any reducing diet must provide fewer calories.
If a man needs 3,000 calories a day to maintain his weight with his habits of life, he should eat 2,000 calories a day to reduce two pounds a week.
It is generally dangerous to lose weight faster.
The food items in a reducing diet must be well balanced.
That is, they must provide enough of all the nutrients needed for good health.
There is no evidence that extreme diets for example "low carbohydrates" or "low protein" diets, or those based on single foods have any advantage over well-balanced diets.
A reducing diet should also be good in taste and easy to buy and cook.
An expert nutritionist has advised that a person going on a reducing diet should get more exercise.
But an obese person, one who is otherwise healthy, should not suddenly start a programme of prolonged, heavy exercise.
The strain on the heart would be dangerous.
An exercise programme should be developed gradually.
One good way is to start to take daily walks, and increasing their duration.
More demanding exercises can be added as the person becomes thinner and fitter.
There is no love sincerer than the love of food", said George Bernard Shaw.
Obesity is more common in the affluent society.
Charles Dickens in 'Pickwick Papers' describes a character, Joe, a fat fellow who gets doused at the most inappropriate occasions.
Fat people enjoy their laziness.
They feel breathless after exertion and become tired quickly.
The fat and the thin may eat the same amount of food.
The thin people are more active and so they consume their calories.
The fat do not, their extra calories get deposited at all the wrong places in the body.
The obese are generally of a cool temperament and look healthy but they fall prey to many diseases.
When a person is overweight, thirty percent of his span of life is reduced.
It is better to consider 20% overweight as compared to average weight as obese.
The simplest method to know if a person is obese is to measure his skin fold thickness with the help of a calliper.
Generally, it may be done on the back of the arm If is thicker than 23 mm in men and 30 mm in women the person is obese.
People tend to get obese as they get older.
They reach the peak around the age of 50.
We find few obese people living till old age.
They generally succumb to many obesity-related diseases.
There are two types of people who are obese.
One type of people are obese throughout their growth.
Obese women gain weight with each pregnancy.
They are grossly fat and may become overweight by 175%.
Their fatness is more around their limbs.
The other type is those who grow fat during middle age.
Life becomes sedentary, less and less active as we grow.
The calorie requirement goes down.
It has been estimated that the intake lessens by 43 calories with every decade in the males and 27 calories in the females.
Food habits do not change with age.
When the calorie requirement is reduced, we continue to consume the same amount of food.
Extra calories start depositing fat in the body.
This generally leads to central obesity, fat deposits around the abdomen and chest.
The fat cells increase in number and size and the process continues throughout the childhood.
Among the non-obese people the proliferation of fat cells takes place for the first two years of childhood and then just prior to puberty.
It has been noticed that the non-obese persons, if they are forcefully fed, they gain in weight by 20-30%.
Their fat cells increase in size but not in number and as soon as the forced feeding stops, they come back to their original weight.
In the obese if the fat cells are removed through an operation as is sometimes done by some enthusiastic surgeons, in due course the remaining fat cells increase in size and proliferate and the person once again becomes overweight.
When you are depressed, you tend to eat more.
When you feel lonely and there is nothing to do with a lot of food lying around in the house, you tend to feed yourself.
Average college going girls are generally thin.
When they leave college they may get married.
In a few years, they become fat.
After college their physical activity decreases.
Left with no other diversion and entertainment they tend to concentrate more on eating.
Their desire to look glamorous is also at lower ebb.
Socio-economic influences rather than hereditary are directly responsible for obesity.
A mother who tells the child that ghee (Butter oil) is good for it is doing more harm than any hereditary cause.
Psychological factors play an important role in preventing obese persons to lose weight.
They eat at night, because of some guilt syndrome and body image disturbance.
A girl, 22 years old, has a perfect diet during the day but at night in a semi-conscious state she will walk up to the kitchen and eat vast quantities of food.
Fat children are often seen to eat a lot.
A child who eats 3-4 ice creams and drinks two milk shakes on top of it is not rare.
A bride was happy with her 85 lbs on the wedding day.
But 10 years later she was equally content with a body weight of 135 lbs.
It calls for a lot of persuasion to keep an obese person on the right track.
The height weight charts sometimes are not useful at all.
It is better to develop an ideal body weight concept.
This is more realistic and encourages the patient to work harder to be thin.
Fatness is often mistaken for good health, but it is not true.
A fat body harbours diseases better.
Fat people generally suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure, heart ailments, gall bladder stones, arthritis, bloating in the tummy and liver complications.
These diseases produce a higher mortality among the obese, compared to thinner people.
But luckily all of this can be reversed.
The results can be dramatic if only they reduce weight.
In the US out of every four persons one is on a weight reducing diet.
There is great health consciousness.
Thousands can be seen jogging and taking health foods.
The cholesterol level is higher among the fat persons.
This is because, fat deposits find their way into the blood stream Cholesterol which is a fat and in blood stream, it makes the blood more viscous.
It gets deposited in the lumen of the blood vessels making them thinner and making it more difficult for the blood to flow.
The lumen of the coronary arteries supplying the heart also gets narrowed down.
The supply of blood to the heart is reduced and it may result in heart diseases.
The cholesterol is also linked with gall bladder stones.
Super saturation of bile with cholesterol helps to form gall stones.
It is more common among females who are obese, around forty and of fair complexion.
During pregnancy and in case of a diabetic child there may be a need for higher doses, twice daily.
Patients may have a hypoglycaemic reaction when the sugar levels reaches levels lower than what is required.
These patients should carry sugar cubes or biscuits and eat them when such a situation arises.
There can be absorption of subcutaneous fat at the site of injection, skin rashes, fluid retention and visual disturbance.
They are sulphonyl urea drugs and include tolbutamide, chlorpropamide, acetohexamide, tolazamide and glybenclamide.
They are given only when diabetes is not controlled by diet and exercise.
This drug acts on the pancreas and stimulates it to excrete more insulin.
An American study suggests that tolbutamide has failed to prevent the disease and even made it worse.
It may cause the lowering of sugar to levels much lower than required and this may affect the brain.
Eight hundred patients taking oral anti-diabetic drugs were researched for 3-8 years.
The study showed that during this period 89 patients died.
The side effects may be serious if the patient is KEPT for a long time on this drug.
It increases intolerance to alcohol and causes facial flushing.
Biguanides like phenformine and metaformine drugs have been prohibited in the United States by Food and Drug Administration.
Side effects are loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and lactic acidosis.
10 to 20 percent patients do not respond to oral agents and treatment is termed as primary failure.
New onset of disease responds better than old standing diabetes.
If it cannot be controlled by diet then oral drugs can be added.
These patients are first given oral drugs and if this fails then doctors take recourse to insulin.
When diabetes is controlled the patient is put back on oral medication.
With exercise and diet your expectancy of youthful years will not decrease.
If you are careless, if you cannot control yourself, cannot push yourself to doing exercise or you do not have enough determination to stick to the right diet, then you are taking a great risk.
The time, you know you are diabetic, gather courage and compel yourself to change the way of life.
It is not an easy task because you have lived in a particular style for years and being used to it, it is difficult to give up old habits
You have lived this way and got your diabetes.
If you are a diabetic you must exercise vigorously.
If you are old and if you cannot do exercise, then at least you must walk in the morning and in the evening one hour each time.
Take boiled vegetables (preferably 250 grams), salads, curds and dry chapatti for lunch and dinner.
Even before the weight starts dropping the sugar level begins decreasing.
Maybe for a few days you will feel weak due to cutting down on calories but in 2-3 weeks you will get more strength and energy to walk longer distances.
In two to three months the blood sugar will come to normal, if you are a mild to moderate diabetic.
If you are highly diabetic, oral ant diabetic drugs will be necessary.
But you can drop the drug in 6 months to one year time if you stick to the routine.
Once you have reached the normal blood sugar level, the most difficult task starts.
If you are carried away by the craving for good food etc your sugar level will rise again and all the hard work will be wasted.
Many a times when the patient goes for a blood test he is told that his sugar is slightly high.
The patient comes back with the impression that there is nothing wrong and he need not worry and that he can carry on with almost the same diet with little restrictions.
The diet should be restricted completely to bring down the blood sugar to normal.
It should not be allowed to cross the normal level of blood sugar.
Such a patient should have a regular check of blood sugar, at 6 months intervals or at least once a year.
Many patients do vigorous dieting when they have detected that they are diabetics.
Unfortunately, once the sugar level comes down they feel that they have been cured and start eating everything.
After bringing down the sugar level by dieting, do not start gobbling all sorts of food because the sugar level will climb in no time.
There are many patients who do not bother to restrict their diet and keep on taking drugs.
If they go for a celebration they try to counter the sugar increase by swallowing a tablet.
Restrict your diet to bring down the sugar level to normal, supplement it with a drug if sugar level is still too high.
If you depend on drugs only, these will shorten life and cause harm.
It is better than having a heart attack or cancer ailments which hardly give any time to mend the ways, even if you are willing to do so.
Bowels should move well and if needed plain water enema can be used.
The response to the diet in the lowering of blood sugar is faster.
The weight loss is a source of moral support to patients and they are motivated easily.
As the patient loses weight the production of glucose by the liver is slowed down.
Insulin resistance comes down with the increase in the number of insulin receptors.
The insulin action becomes more effective and the secretion of beta cells is increased.
When the patient is given a low calorie diet, the calories are distributed throughout the day, evenly in major meals.
The body should not be loaded with calories in one meal.
This is essential as the metabolic activity of the body is impaired in diabetes.
If the blood sugar is high, insulin or other anti-diabetic drugs may be needed and then the time of meals should be adjusted according to medication.
The quantity of the drug is gradually reduced as the blood sugar level goes down and in most cases it can be completely withdrawn.
A regular check of blood sugar level and regular consultation with a physician will be necessary for this purpose.
In adult diabetics, the insulin secretion is still present and as the low calorie diet proceeds in, it can be stimulated further and the need of the drug will no more be necessary.
Carbohydrates should be spread throughout the day in all meals and liberal quantities of all fruits including dates and bananas could be added, if sugar levels are not very high.
Take plenty of complex starches, found in small quantities in lentils and plenty in rice, wheat and potatoes.
You are allowed to have potatoes, wheat and rice even if you are a diabetic.
Root vegetables need not be restricted at all.
Fruits can be taken in plenty, they hardly play any role in raising the blood sugar level and they do not need insulin for their metabolism Fructose (sugar found in fruits) is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract more slowly than sugar and is taken up and metabolised by liver.
By this non-insulin dependent mechanism the liver fructose is ultimately converted into glycogen and triglycerides.
You can be liberal with fruits even sweet fruits like grapes, chikoos and mangoes.
If you eat apples or carrots you are taking in a lot of fibres along with the juice.
A few carrots or apples will give you ample supply of fibres for the whole day.
Fibres should be plenty in the diet; they are the constituent of food which the body does not absorb.
They are plenty in green salads, vegetables, fruits, in bran of rice and husk of wheat, also in unrefined carbohydrates and complex starches.
The sugar raising quality of carbohydrates is much reduced if there are plenty of fibres.
The fibre is a friend of the digestive system It forms a gel in the digestive system which slows down the absorption of sugar.
It cuts down the absorption of fats and so the bowels move speedily and clearly.
The first man to advocate fibre was Dr John Harvey Kellog, founder of Battle Greek Sanatorium, Michigan, and U.S.A.
He was struck by the fact that few diseases common in the west were not common in third world countries, like diabetes and heart diseases.
He concluded that the growing consumption of refined sugar and white bread was responsible for it.
Refining carbohydrates has several consequences, one of which is the removal of fibres.
This has an undesirable effect on the digestive and circulatory systems.
Gastric emptying is delayed and overall absorption and digestion of carbohydrates is slowed down.
In the Indian diet high carbohydrates and high fibres are naturally available.
This is why the Indian diet is far superior to that of the westerners for the prevention of many diseases.
Several adaptations to food health requirements are to be made here and there.
The average Indian diet contains 60% carbohydrates, 20% proteins and 20% fats.
It shows that high carbohydrates-high fibre diet is ideal for diabetes.
The Indian diet is mostly vegetarian and cereal based.
In the western diet the fibre content has to be increased by adding gaur gum, bran and other sources of fibre, but the Indian dietary pattern, cereals and pulses is a natural source of high fibre.
We only need to stop refining food, stop using white flour (Maida) and sugar which is refined food with no fibres.
All non-vegetarian foods do not contain fibres.
So a vegetarian diet is better for diabetes.
Extra large quantities of salads, green vegetables, wheat with bran and impounded rice are strongly recommended.
The West is suffering the most because the diet consists of less fibre.
The diet has non-vegetarian foods (no fibre) fats (no fibres), milk products (no fibre) and sugar (no fibre).
Children and pregnant mothers need not take high fibre diet.
Children and pregnant mothers need more nutrition and fibre food is only high bulk food.
To guide a patient regarding his diet to which he will adhere for life is a complex job.
This will need considering the life style, economic status, food preferences and social pressures.
This will also need special training on the part of a physician to guide his patient to the satisfactory goal which is when the patient can eat to his taste and satisfaction.
The doctor is then happy that he could include a diet where the fibre content is large.
Stress can be a causative factor for diabetes.
Stress increases the sugar level in the blood in the diabetics.
Due to stress, the hypothalamus in the brain is stimulated, which in turn stimulates the pituitary gland.
Modern life is full of stress and strain and the relaxation techniques will help the diabetics.
There is always the production of insulin in the pancreas.
But either it is insufficient or it is not effective due to the formation of antibodies.
They can be controlled in most cases by diet and exercises only.
There are other conditions where the production of insulin may completely cease as in the case of cancer and infection of pancreas.
Here the patient will need insulin along with diet control.
In a few cases, diabetes may develop in childhood, juvenile diabetes.
So the diet must have sufficient calories.
They cannot be controlled without insulin.
The insulin injection and food timings are so adjusted that the intake of food coincides with the optimum level of drugs in the blood.
These patients are much fewer in number than those with diabetes mellitus.
Diabetes mellitus affects 2-4% of the total population, whereas 2% of the total diabetic patients are juvenile diabetics.
Juvenile diabetes, if uncontrolled, can develop into ketosis.
In extreme insulin insufficiency ketone bodies are released in blood and there by pass out in urine.
Such a patient feels unwell, may develop nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain.
Subsequently he becomes drowsy and goes into coma.
The condition is fatal if left untreated.
The hope that these drugs would be a salvation diminished.
These drugs should be given only when diet and exercise have failed to control the disease.
In severe diabetes, insulin is given at least initially and then switched over to oral drugs.
Insulin is given by injection, just under the skin.
It is short or long acting and can be combined in one injection so that it will be sufficient for a whole day.
In diabetes insipidus, the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, a part of the brain, does not function normally.
The leading cause of death in India is diabetes mellitus.
The body of a diabetic person cannot make a normal use of sugar, and so sugar builds up in the blood.
The kidneys discharge some of the excess sugar in the urine.
In severe cases of diabetes, fats and proteins cannot also be used normally.
Most physicians once believed that all cases of diabetes were caused by a lack of the hormone - insulin - which is produced in the pancreas and enables the body to use and store sugar.
Many diabetics especially those who become diabetic, after the age of 40, have normal or even above normal production of insulin.
Symptoms of diabetes are excessive urination, great thirst, hunger and loss of weight and strength.
The "Type I" diabetes strikes some people so suddenly that the lack of insulin causes an emergency condition called diabetic ketoacidosis.
There is excessive urination, thirst, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting and difficulty in breathing.
If the victim is not treated promptly, he may go into diabetic coma, with fatal results.
Most "Type I" diabetics follow carefully planned diets consisting of measured amounts of carbohydrates, fats and proteins.
The "Type II" diabetes can be controlled by a diet low in calories.
The nerves can be affected by diabetes leading to a loss of feeling or abnormal sensations in different parts of the body.
It can cause strokes, heart failure or gangrene.
The affluent western world has more cases of diabetes than the third world countries.
Urban population has more cases of diabetes than the rural population.
The urban rich have more victims than the urban poor.
Diabetes mellitesis is derived from the word mellitus which means honey.
So the name diabetes mellitus is given because the urine is sweet like honey.
The glucose level in the urine and in the blood is high.
This occurs when the pancreas fails to produce sufficient insulin due to antibodies which are formed in the blood which interfere with the normal functioning of insulin.
In either case there is a high level of glucose in the blood.
When we consume more sugar, more insulin is produced to check the blood sugar and does not let it go higher than normal level.
If the pancreas is overburdened for a long time due to increased consumption of sugar it starts failing.
Some volunteers were given a high sugar diet for 14 days and in one-third of the number the insulin level in the blood rose.
It proved that there is a group of people who are more prone to diabetes if they consume more sugar.
Few have a high glucose level and it is easy to identify them When there is early diabetes and the glucose level is not so high.
Blood and urine are tested for glucose early in the morning before food.
Later 75 grams of glucose is given through the mouth and blood samples collected at half hourly intervals for 2 hours.
Our Professor of Medicine, at the college, Dr B .K . Gupta stressed in his opening remarks on diabetes "if you know diabetes you know your medicine".
Diabetes can aggravate any disease of the body, cause complications and make it more difficult to cure.
Diabetes generally appears as polyuria (frequent urination), you may have to get up a few times for urination at night, polydipsia (increased thirst).
You may lose weight in spite of normal or increased appetite.
You may have aches and pains in the body, weakness, a boil or carbuncle of skin which does not heal rapidly.
You may have variety of infections like tuberculosis, infection of kidney (pyelonephritis).
You may have retinal detachment or even loss of vision, may develop infection in the feet which may turn into gangrene and require amputation if the disease is not checked at an early stage.
There is an increase in still births of pregnant women in a diabetic condition.
Diabetes can complicate arthritis.
You name any problem of the body and diabetes could be there to complicate the situation.
It is always essential to check for diabetes if a person is suffering from any ailment and is not recovering fast, particularly approaching when 40 check for diabetes every year.
Diabetes can be treated effectively with the co-operation of the patient.
If you have a high glucose level in the urine and the blood, the first most important thing to do is to control the diet.
Cut down sugar completely if you are a clear cut diabetic case.
This will bring down the sugar level to some extent.
Now the per consumption has reached 90 kg. per head in UK and 80 kgs. in the USA .
Eminent professor of nutrition in the London University, Dr John Yudkin said that this great increase in the consumption of sugar has come so quickly, measured on the evolutionary scale, that the humans had no time to adapt to it.
He infers that due to increased consumption of sugar there is a great increase in heart disease and diabetes.
During World War I and II the sugar consumption declined due to rationing and there was marked decline in diabetic mortality.
Nutritionist, Dr Yudkin showed the relationship between the high sugar consumption and diabetes in 22 countries.
Since the time sugar and white bread have been introduced the incidence has increased.
These refined carbohydrates are pinpointed as causing unprecedented increase in diabetes and heart diseases.
We have to gear up our energy and try to reverse the process by changing the food habits.
The best part of diabetes is that even if you have it, you can have a normal active prolonged life if you keep tabs on your sugar level through regular check-ups.
Diabetes can attack the kidneys, heart or any of the vital organs of the body and cause the end of a useful, productive and purposeful life.
This can be done by reducing the amount of calories consumed per day.
This will help to decrease the sugar level in blood.
Exercise will be an added advantage as it increases the use of calories and the reduction of weight will be faster.
The average amount of calories spent by a sedentary worker is 30 kcal/per kg bodyweight per day.
If physical activity is increased without changing the diet, the use of calories will go up and the weight will get reduced.
The fat tissue is an inert mass and does not participate in the activity of the body.
Greater the fat deposit in the body less will be the calorie requirement per kg body weight.
If you take fewer calories than normally required you will reduce the weight.
It is better to have a slow weight loss for a prolonged period than to reduce drastically in a short period.
If you restrict calories (food) to a modest degree your energy will be maintained, you will be able to carry on your routine work and take exercises also.
The food taken must be balanced and there should be a good psychological support.
Lower the amount of calories you take, bigger the weight loss.
The diet should be restricted in calories but it should be full of vitamins and micronutrients.
In an obese person the diet can be a low calorie diet but it should be nutritionally sound.
This can be done in a health farm as you can easily get a supportive environment.
At home there will be a need for a lot of motivation and regular visits to the physician.
The level of glucose in plasma (the liquid part of the blood) starts going down as soon as we go on calorie restrictive diet, even before significant weight loss.
The glucose level achieved can be maintained on calorie restricted diet.
Generally the diet recommended should have a lot of green vegetables, salads, fruits, sprouted grains, curd, pulses and chapattis.
Concentrated high calorie food should be avoided like cheese, butter, ghee, sweets, samosas, bhajias, sugar, ice creams, cold drinks and alcohol.
Different fruits with sprouted grains on different days for breakfast and salad, green vegetables, curds and chapattis for lunch are ideal.
Some fruits in the afternoon or a glass of juice can be taken.
In the mornings you should have a one-hour brisk walk.
As you progress, blood pressure will come down.
Blood cholesterol and glycerides will start falling, moving towards normal levels.
Relation between the physician and patient is important.
Many patients drop out and are not seen on the next appointment.
A few will do by a deliberate rejection of therapy, but in most cases it is because of less proper understanding of the disease.
A well run clinic should have a proper record of attendance and issue reminder, if required.
Diuretics (chlorothiazide and related drugs) are important as they help in the excretion of extra salt from the body.
The disadvantage with a diuretic is that needed potassium salt is also excreted out simultaneously and must be supplemented with fruit juices or potassium supplements.
Side effect may cause impotency in men, potassium depletion, rise in uric acid levels, nausea, dizziness, rashes, numbness, pins and needles.
Beta blockers (practolol and propranolol) reduce the rate and force of the contraction of heart and reduce the cardiac output.
Side effects may be breathlessness and swelling of the ankles.
Long term use may elevate triglycerides and lower high density cholesterol which is good for heart.
The main cause of high blood pressure is constriction of peripheral blood vessels.
These drugs help to dilate them and bring down blood pressure.
They increase the heart rate and force the contraction of the heart.
Side effects are flushing of skin, headaches, palpitation, gastrointestinal disturbances, dizziness and fluid retention.
Centrally acting drugs cause drowsiness, and dry mouth, anaemia, diarrhoea, skin rash and even drug induced fever after 15 days.
Clonidine, in addition to above side effects, may also cause constipation, tremor, sweating and insomnia.
Adrenergic Neuron Blocking drugs are very effective in reducing blood pressure.
Ejaculation during sexual intercourse in males may be inhibited.
It may cause diarrhoea, slow heart rate, weakness and nasal stuffiness.
Reserpine is derived from a plant Raulfia Serpentina used in India for centuries.
Side effects are Slow heart rate, aggravation of peptic ulcer, diarrhoea, drowsiness, depression etc.
These drugs have a different mode of action and several side effects.
They are quite often given in combination so that their doses can be reduced and thus the side effects.
It will also depend on the age, season, profession of the patient etc.
Before we start the treatment it should be well understood that it is a lifelong treatment.
If they are stopped, blood pressure will come back to pre-treatment level or even a little more.
Generally, blood pressure is treated with the hope to prevent a stroke or heart attack.
Various studies have shown however that it hardly alters the course of terminal disease.
Other drugs, stopped suddenly, may worsen angina pectoris or even cause myocardial infarction.
It is important to remember that if we are on a drug for a long time it is always advisable to gradually reduce it and then stop it though it may take weeks or months.
The benefit of medicinal treatment to reduce high blood pressure is still doubtful in spite of a lot of research.
Hypertension can better be controlled by diet and special relaxation techniques rather than customary medical care.
If we control blood pressure and cannot control the other risk factors like smoking, fat consumption, lack of exercise and tension the results are negative.
Medical treatment will do more harm than good if we are only depending on drugs, doing nothing to change the lifestyle.
The West has very clearly understood the invalidity of medicinal treatment in the prevention of a heart attack or stroke.
Death due to heart attack is common in the west due to affluence and all the luxuries available to them.
Every year over 3.5 million people die in India due to heart attacks.
The west has become more health conscious.
The number of people smoking cigarettes is reducing every year.
They have taken to jogging and eating a lot of fibre foods like salads, fruits and boiled vegetables and cutting down on meats.
For good health's sake, it is time we became conscious of the way of life as medicinal treatment holds little hope.
Cut down sugar, oils (including ghee and butter) salt, white flour, tea and coffee.
This is to help you to urinate more and excrete waste products from the body.
A luke warm water enema if you feel constipated is recommended.
Exercises increase blood pressure; this is why it is better to start with easy exercises.
As the body gets used to exercise, blood pressure will be more stable.
Exercise will help increase the circulation of blood.
There will be less chances of arteries getting blocked, causing heart attack.
A blood vessel in the brain can give way and cause a paralytic shock.
Learn to deal with your business or job effectively if it is causing tension.
Try to do the corpse pose (sava-asana) every day, try relaxation techniques.
Have good quality sleep, at least 8-9 hours every day.
Take 1-2 hours rest in the afternoon after lunch.
Whenever you feel uneasy it is always advisable to take a body wash before going to bed if you have problems getting sleep.
Pranayama is good for blood pressure as it ventilates the lungs better and causes relaxation.
Steam and sauna should not be taken when blood pressure is high.
Anyway, do not take it for a long time, you can take it preferably for more than 3-6 minutes twice a week.
Massage is good but should be done lightly, should be done in the direction away from the heart.
Take the massage in the sun if it is cold.
If the diastolic pressure exceeds 104 the chances are 10 times more of getting a stroke than if the diastolic is less than 85 mm of Hg.
Salt and the tongue have been in love with each other for centuries.
The tongue is so much used to salty taste that to separate the two is to make lives salt less, a proverb commonly used to indicate that all pleasures have departed from life.
Those who, as a matter of habit, consume more salt have a higher average blood pressure than those who consume less salt.
Too much sodium, an unwanted ingredient in salt, is the principal cause of high blood pressure.
Too much sodium also causes the body to excrete much needed potassium salts.
The load on the kidneys increases when we take in more salt.
Salt helps to retain water in the body.
Now it is clearly acknowledge that more salt is injurious to health.
Cutting down on salt will bring down blood pressure.
It affects the walls of the arteries and makes them more sensitive to stimulation.
Generally, the palate is conditioned to salty foods.
Instead, use herbs like dhania leaves pudina leaves and curry leaves and mild spices, like onion, garlic, radish or even mild masala like jeera, dhania, haladi and mustard seeds etc.
Avoid processed food and pickles which are known to have too much salt.
Slow moving rural folk, who are in close contact with nature, have fewer problems with blood pressure.
A study of Pacific Islanders showed that the group in closer contact with the modern ways of society has higher blood pressure than those found in communities from where they migrated.
Cigarette smoking not only increases blood pressure and heart rate but also affects the quality and the quantity of blood reaching the heart.
Nicotine in cigarette increases heart rate and blood pressure.
Carbon monoxide which is inhaled along with the smoke affects blood as far as the release of oxygen, is concerned.
It reduces heart rate and blood pressure.
The collateral blood supply to the heart increases, increasing the total amount of blood reaching to the heart musculature.
To help the heart, stop smoking cigarettes and start doing exercise.
A good physician always checks the blood pressure.
If a patient is found to be suffering from high blood pressure he should be advised to check his blood pressure regularly.
Unfortunately many cases are detected very late after the onset of heart attack or stroke or after death.
It needs understanding, friendly inspiring and a polite physician.
It is important to explain to him his disease, why one gets high blood pressure, what damage it can cause and how long it will take for blood pressure to harm the body.
Most patients suffer from mild to moderately high blood pressure.
In none of the individual clinical trials carried so far, no significant benefits were noted after long term proper treatment by medication.
It will not be wise to assume that new drugs which have come into the market will be safe and effective till they have been tried for several years.
These drugs only lower the blood pressure, and do not do anything to reverse the process of progressive damage being done to the body.
It is important to know the significant role played by diet, exercise, relaxation and the beneficial effects of non-smoking.
The aim of a treatment is to reduce the risk of getting a heart attack or a stroke.
The treatment will depend on the level of the blood pressure and the number of risk factors it carries.
If blood pressure is high the immediate need is to reduce it.
In a majority of cases where blood pressure is mild to moderately high, giving up cigarettes and starting a proper diet can work wonders.
If you are obese, a reduction in body weight will help to bring down blood pressure.
Be prepared for a long journey of diet control, less fat, less salt, less sugar, complex carbohydrates and more fibres.
Take a lot of fibres in the form of salads, green vegetables and fruits in the diet.
Exercises help reduce heart rate and blood pressure.
Athletes have a slower pulse rate than a normal person.
Do meditation to help bring down blood pressure.
Studies have shown that during meditation there is 25 percent decrease in cardiac output, compared with a 20 percent decrease during sleep.
The heart rate falls by about 5 beats a minute.
Researchers have found evidence of reduction of blood pressure.
Meditation helps in two ways - first it induces a relaxed state of your body and mind which is useful in moments of stress.
Second, although, this is less clear, it seems to have some direct physiological effects which are beneficial to those who are prone to coronary diseases.
It takes years for blood pressure to develop and it takes months to control it and reverse the process and set right the damages caused by blood pressure to the body.
Be prepared to hold your destiny in your hands.
It depends upon the strength and rate of the heart's contraction, the volume of blood in the circulatory system and the elasticity of the arteries.
The sphygmomanometer is used to measure blood pressure.
The pressure at which the flow of blood resumes is called the systolic pressure, it represents the blood pressure when the heart is contracting.
This pressure is determined by reading the gauge or the scale on the mercury tubes.
The pressure at this point is called the diastolic pressure, represents the pressure when the heart is relaxing.
It rises with age because arteries become less elastic and slow down the flow of blood.
Blood is the life stream of the human body, this red fluid performs many tasks and no part of the body can live without it.
Blood supplies the cells of the body with the food and oxygen they need for work and growth.
It carries waste products to special organs that remove them from the body or break them down into harmless substances.
The amount of blood depends on the size and the environment of each person.
The heart pumps the blood through the body.
It flows from the heart through the arteries and it returns to the heart through the veins.
The large arteries that leave the heart carry blood into smaller and smaller vessels.
The smallest of these vessels are the narrow thin walled capillaries.
Blood flows from capillaries into large veins until it reaches the great veins that enter the heart.
The four main parts are plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets.
A palmist looks at the hand and predicts the future.
An astrologer reads the horoscope and relates all about your life.
A physician is also in a good position to predict your future health by measuring blood pressure.
He is able to confirm whether you are a candidate for a stroke or a heart attack.
He may be able to foretell the approximate expectancy of life if you do not wish to change the life style.
To make the prediction more correct a few additional things have to be known.
The more risk factors you have, along with high blood pressure, greater are the chances that you will fall a prey to heart attack or stroke at an early date.
Risk factors are age, cigarette smoking, high fat levels (cholesterol and glycerides) in the blood, diabetes, obesity and changes in X-ray and electro-cardiogram.
This is why the physician gives a thorough examination, takes the cardiogram and sends the blood for different tests.
He will suggest reducing the risk factors and blood pressure to avoid stroke and heart attack.
Most people ignore blood pressure, as it, in most cases, symptomless, to their great cost.
They may pay for this carelessness with a stroke or death.
A few may have headaches, breathlessness on exertion and blurred vision.
Even if you do not ignore it you tend to take tablets to get rid of the symptoms, But blood pressure is a lifelong ailment and has to be treated as such, once the root cause is found.
In order to maintain the blood supply to all parts of the body, the heart has to pump blood at a certain pressure.
Even in a healthy person, the blood pressure varies from moment to moment to meet different demands of the body.
When you get up, it takes little time for the blood pressure to rise to a normal level.
Gradually, as time goes on the body begins to show the strain of high blood pressure, may be after 5 years, 10 years or even more.
It comes all of a sudden without a warning in the form of a stroke or heart attack.
The heart has to work harder when you suffer from high blood pressure.
Under a prolonged strain, the arteries become hardened and thickened reducing the blood supply.
Abruptly, it may block the artery, totally cutting off the blood supply to the heart.
The heart deprived of nourishment at the time when it is overworked and fatigued is forced to work harder to push the blood through obstruction.
Unless something is done a heart attack is just around the corner.
A small artery under the strain of high blood pressure can burst in the brain and cause a stroke.
Under the strain of high blood pressure, the kidneys can fail in course of time.
There may be difficulty in walking, due to atherosclerosis in the legs, called intermittent claudicating.
The blood pressure has not created the havoc suddenly.
It was done in the course of many years by high blood pressure and circulating fats in the blood.
Most horrible end of the story will be sudden death or a crippling stroke.
If we are determined, we can even reverse the whole course of the disease in terms of many more years of healthy, youthful and productive life.
Blood pressure rises with emotion and exertion.
On a first visit to a consultant, it may tend to be higher than normal because you are anxious.
It is always better to take rest for 10-15 minutes before the pressure is taken.
A cup of coffee or a cigarette smoked can also raise the pressure count.
Blood pressure keeps on rising throughout life.
It rises rapidly from infant to the baby stage and to teenage.
The rise is slow between 25 years and 40 years.
Women have slightly lower blood pressure than men.
This is the result of a study made by the National Institute of Health in Framingham, Massachusetts (U.S.A).
Risk factors are important to predict the future, if one is suffering from high blood pressure.
A computer programme was constructed by feeding information about risk factors in a computer and the history of two patients was fed to know the additional gravity.
In another survey, a comparison was made between a person of high blood pressure (160 mm of Hg systolic and 95mm of Hg diastolic) and a person having normal blood pressure.
A person with high blood pressure has 3 times more chance of heart failure and 7 times more chance for a stroke.
Cutting down on the risk factors is more important than just reducing blood pressure by drugs and not looking after the other risk factors does not reduce the danger of a heart attack.
A recent study has shown that if you have lower blood pressure and are loaded with other risk factors you have a much higher risk than high blood pressure alone.
It has been revealed that if you take drugs like cholestyramine to reduce the blood fats it does not reduce the risk factor because it does not reduce fat as a whole and does not discriminate between good fats for the heart (high density cholesterol) and bad fats (low density cholesterol).
Trials have shown negative results or even increased mortality with certain drugs
If your parents have high blood pressure you are a more suitable candidate for high blood pressure.
But you may not have the same level of blood pressure as your parents.
One cannot choose parents but he can change the life style, cut down on risk factors and control blood pressure to a great extent.
People with 20% higher body weight will have 3 times more chances of getting high blood pressure.
Keep on reducing diet is the first step, if you are overweight, and have high blood pressure.
Vegetarian diets differ from those of non vegetarian food in their content of fibre, starch, protein, vitamin and minerals.
Some researchers have suggested that strong religious beliefs of Adventists also help them to protect against heart attacks.
One of the most important new developments of the last decade is the realization that cholesterol in the body is a far more complex substance than originally thought.
Cholesterol does not travel loose in the blood but in different combination of proteins called lipoproteins.
There could be low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL).
A high level of LDL is associated with increased risk of heart disease while a high level of HDL is associated with reduced risk.
The emergence of HDL has complicated the measurement of cholesterol profile.
HDL is significantly higher in women than men in all age groups.
This explains why women are less susceptible to heart diseases.
The presence of HDL in part is hereditary and rises with weight reduction, exercise, cessation of smoking and relaxation.
Drugs used to reduce cholesterol levels in blood (Cholestyramine and Clofibrate) reduce the total cholesterol without discriminating the bad (LDL) from the good (HDL) cholesterol.
It is better to use physical means like exercise and reduction of weight, cutting down on fat, stopping smoking and induction of the right diet which reduces bad cholesterol (LDL) and increases good cholesterol (HDL) rather than depending on drugs to reduce the total cholesterol level which does not reduce the risk of heart attack.
Though he covered a wide range of subjects related to heart diseases he kept on returning to the subject of smoking.
He recalled a meeting with businessmen a day earlier in a room filled with smoke.
I distributed my cards to the assembly because they would have to come to me, Dr. Effler snapped.
Cigarette smoking is harmful.
Harm is done to the blood, to the blood vessels and to the heart.
Post mortem reports of smoker's show that changes take place not only in the big coronary artery supplying blood to the heart but also in the thinnest arteries which enter the wall of the heart.
There is a small, scattered thickening in the interior of all these arteries which causes obstruction and reduces the quantity of blood flowing in these arteries.
The more cigarettes you smoke per day these changes will become more pronounced.
These changes are slightly less among cigar and pipe smokers.
The smokers are susceptible to stroke, heart attacks, angina pectoris and intermittent claudicating where blood vessel of legs are narrowed and there is pain in the legs after walking even a small distance and when there is a need to rest before walking further.
Female smokers get this problem more than men smokers.
The risk is 20 times more than that of non-smokers.
Among heavy smokers, who have been smoking cigarettes for several years sudden death is common.
If they can cut down smoking, suddenly and sharply, the risk is definitely reduced.
When we inhale cigarette smoke, the carbon monoxide reaches the blood and combines with haemoglobin and decreases its power of carrying oxygen by five per cent.
Smoking attacks us in two ways.
It narrows the blood vessels and decreases the capacity of the blood to carry oxygen.
Now you can imagine the havoc when blood is of bad quality and when it reaches in lesser quantity to the heart.
If you are a diabetic, the risk of heart disease is more.
It is more prevalent in women than men.
The excess risk is almost twice compared to a non-diabetic.
These patients cannot also go in for a heart transplant.
Immunosuppressant drugs given postoperatively to these patients make diabetes deteriorate dramatically.
If you are not keen on exercises and your work is sedentary, there is a chance of increased risk.
It will increase the potency of other risk factors.
A hard working farmer or a dock worker has definitely a reduced risk of heart attack or sudden death.
The tolerance for exercise can be increased in a coronary heart patient, through a program of regular moderate exercise.
If you have crossed 40, have sex at least once a week, he recommended.
Diabetes or a high level of fats (cholesterol and triglycerides) in blood is passed on to the offspring's.
Commonly, we inherit bad food habits, inactivity, obesity and smoking which add up to the risk.
Coronary bypass surgery is done in advanced cases where the diseased part of the blood vessel of the heart is replaced by a blood vessel taken out from another part of the body.
This is done rarely as patients do not live very long after this operation.
If you have a clot in the blood vessel, drugs can be used effectively to dissolve it.
One of the drugs used is heparin.
The drugs are not free from side effects like bleeding through nose, bruising, fever and allergy.
In less urgent cases coumarin can be used but it can cause bleeding.
If the heart is not working normally, doctors prescribe digitalis to increase the contraction and slow down the heart rate.
It has a tonic action on the heart.
It is difficult to recommend doses.
Like all drugs, digitalis also has side effects: headache, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, tummy pain.
Angina can be treated by drugs like glyceryl trinitrate.
It dilates the blood vessels and allows blood to flow more freely.
It improves blood pressure temporarily and pain is relieved in a short time.
It has side effects like headaches and flushing, high doses can cause spells of dizziness, if one remains on his feet.
These drugs are propranol, timolol and metoprolol.
Propranol is used for high blood pressure, helps the heart to slow down and reduces the strength of heart contractions.
They are not given to people who have already had heart failure.
It should not be given to pregnant, asthmatic and diabetic patients
Side effects are breathlessness; swelling over ankles etc.
These medicaments may become necessary if the heart is diseased.
Diet can help to reduce the fats in the blood and the damage which has already been done.
Control blood pressure, start doing exercise and stop smoking.
This will aid the heart to regain vitality.
Do not look for an easy way, you will be disillusioned and misled.
Medication can give you relief.
It can control blood pressure, reduce the cholesterol level.
It can control the rhythm of the heart beat but it will not reduce the risk of a heart attack.
To save yourself from an impending heart attack, you will have to change your life style, change food habits, take more offs from work, learn to relax, develop interest in exercises, games and take long walks.
Stop taking alcohol, excessive tea and coffee.
If you are just depending on drugs, you are treading on a knife's edge.
If you experience a heart attack, be calm and Lie down in bed.
Do not move till the doctor arrives, examines you thoroughly and takes your cardiogram.
It is always better to get admitted to a cardiac unit of a good hospital.
If hospital facilities can be arranged at home, it is alright to be treated at home.
Often, exertion caused in moving into hospital may cause further damage to the heart.
Medication is important at this stage to alleviate the pain and control the rhythm of the heart.
Intravenous drips will be necessary to alleviate shock.
For intravenous drug therapy the heart must be monitored continuously.
The first ninety six hours are very crucial.
About 90 percent of patients suffer from arrhythmia called "ventricular ectopy" during this period.
At this time proper medical care is crucial.
Be calm, do not get agitated or excited.
Have a cheerful disposition.
Most of the uncomplicated cases of myocardial infarction are shifted from intensive care unit to the ward or private room where the heart will still be monitored for rate and rhythm for some more days.
These patients are allowed to sit in a chair a few times a day for short intervals.
Resumption of sexual activity and mild exercise is allowed in 4 weeks.
They are gradually rehabilitated and are allowed to return to work in 6-8 weeks.
It will suffer for lack of blood and therefore lack of oxygen.
The blockade of artery in the brain can cause a stroke.
When the heart's own blood supply is affected it may cause heart pain called angina pectoris.
When stress is put on the heart by exertion it needs more blood, but it cannot get it due to narrowed arteries and shows it off in the form of heart pain.
Heart attack or myocardial infarction will occur when the blood supply is suddenly cut off completely by a clot of blood or atheroma lodged in the coronary artery the artery which supplies blood to the heart.
Atherosclerosis progresses slowly through the years starting from the childhood.
When the internal lining of blood vessels starts degenerating or gets injured these fats infiltrate the vessel wall.
This fat consists of cholesterol, triglycerides and phospholipids.
This is why measuring levels of all these fats in blood becomes important in all heart diseases.
Smooth muscle cells are the main constituent of the arterial wall.
The circulating fat along with proteins called lipoproteins enter the degenerated internal lining of the vessel gets deposited.
The smooth muscle cells and connective tissue spread around this fat and protein deposits.
This fat and protein undergo metabolism and are deposited in the wall of the vessels for good.
They make elevated blobs of masses in the interior of the blood vessel.
This elevated mass is named as plaque.
There occurs calcification in advance lesions.
Haemorrhage also occurs inside this plaque from small growing blood vessels.
Gradually the size of the plaque increases and it becomes more solid.
The blood flowing in these vessels can be measured with an instrument which takes "blood pressure".
The blood flowing with force also erodes the surface of the elevated masses of fat deposits or plaque.
The surface of the plaque gets roughened and forms a natural site for platelets to get stuck and aggregation can occur quickly.
This helps the plaque to grow in size.
The havoc these plaques can play depends on their site.
If they are there in the thighs they are not so dangerous.
But if they are in the heart or brain they can kill or paralyze.
Many factors play a part in the plaque formation and the speed with which they can grow in size.
Diabetes, obesity, smoking, diet, tension are important.
If we know the risk factors, their reduction will help avoid heart diseases.
With blood pressure, there is a greater risk to get a heart disease or stroke.
If hypertension is more than 100 diastolic, medical interventions is justified.
The seeds of heart disease are sown early in childhood.
Heart diseases can be drastically reduced if you reduce the risk factor in children.
If a child is obese, encourage him to do exercise and eat simple carbohydrates.
A study showed that 15 per cent decrease in body weight will cause 4 per cent reduction in blood cholesterol, 7 per cent improvement in peak work performed and a 16 per cent improvements in total work performed.
Members of families that are known to have a history of premature disease are fit candidates for a stroke or hypertension.
Even their children may show patterns of coronary heart disease.
Dr. Charles J.Glueck of the University of Cincinnati of Medicine, Tucson, U.S.A. in "Genesis of Atherosclerosis" has conclusively proved that the stage for heart attacks and strokes starts in childhood.
The age at which atherosclerosis is most reversible is certainly in the mid to late teens.
Children who display impatience, time urgency and competitiveness (called type A) are far more likely to have a heart attack than those who are more easy going (called type B).
The characteristics have been noticed as early as Kindergarten.
We have seen five years olds who are impatient with themselves or always in a hurry", a professor of Psychiatry claims.
Children are often pressurized to use their time productively.
Children are tied up with organized sports, music lessons, dancing lessons, home work; they are often busier more than most of us.
Children are encouraged to set increasingly higher goals by parents who want the best for them.
Some families create lofty standards just by silently disapproving of anything less than a top job.
This does not mean that a youngster who studies hard or practices enthusiastically for a team should be discouraged.
It is important to distinguish between hard work and hard driving.
In short, problems arise when type-A behaviour is carried to the extreme, ostensibly to help the child set a good example.
Adults should be aware of their own-type-A behaviour that their children may imitate.
If the dad typically dashes from meeting to meeting, it will be hard for his children to learn how to relax.
To prevent the sense of powerlessness, the children should be involved in deciding about things concerning them.
It will be more soothing for a child to be asked if his problem has been eased rather than enquire about the score he got in the test?
Encourage children to do their best, rather than compare themselves to others.
Coronary heart diseases are less common in women under 50 than in men.
In the West with the prevalence of smoking, the ratio has come down to one to three.
Women wanted to do the work of men, accept all responsibilities and pleasures of men, So they have to pay the price for it.
After the age of 50 which also corresponds to menopause, the occurrence of diseases is almost similar to that of men.
This can also be described as, risk increases in women and decreases in men after the age of 50.
This is due to the fact that high risk men are already eliminated before the age of 50 by death or they already have had their first heart attack.
If it is as high as 160 systolic and 100 diastolic as compared to the persons with normal blood pressure, take care.
If you have crossed forty five and have blood pressure you are an easier target for a heart attack or stroke.
Keeping blood pressure in check with the help of drugs is easy but to check the athermanous changes in blood vessels is not.
Of course if you can keep blood pressure in check with low fat diet, exercise and relaxation you can reduce the risk.
Even then remember that good effect starts only after 3 years.
In mid-fifties a report appeared in New York Times which said: Animal fat is tied to heart diseases, cholesterol found in meat, milk and eggs is linked to atherosclerosis.
By 1960s the cholesterol theory - the notion that major risk factor is the elevated circulating fat cholesterol triglycerides became widely accepted among medical professionals.
It is important to note that there is a generalized elevated level of heart attacks among the urban and industrialized population compared to the agriculture society.
78. An increased intake of saturated fats, refined sugar and total calorie by a sedentary population is harmful.
In January 1984, a report on heart, after 10 years of research by a heart, lung and blood institute in the U.S. clearly showed that heart diseases are associated with high cholesterol levels in blood.
They suggested that the cholesterol lowering diet is the master key to preventing heart diseases and should be adopted by everyone.
Dr. Jeremiah Stamler, an eminent heart researcher said: "It is reasonable to designate rich diet as the cause of the current epidemic of premature atherosclerotic diseases raging in the Western industrialized countries".
Some heart researchers hold the view that it is necessary to reduce the consumption of saturated fat - (animal fat as in meat, egg and ghee).
The effect of unsaturated fat (vegetable oils like sunflower, soya bean or corn oil) is not so dangerous.
It means that if food is cooked in 'vegetable oil (instead of ghee or butter) you are less susceptible to atherosclerosis.
The danger is that most people consider that unsaturated fat consumption is healthy.
A Norwegian study on reducing heart diseases came to the conclusion that the best way to minimize heart diseases is to cut down on all fats of whatever kind.
Avoid fried food and if you insist to eat potato fingers cut straight and cut it thick.
If they are crinkle cut or thinly cut they will absorb more oil as their surface area increases.
Do not put oil in your dough or batter because when frying it will be soft but will absorb more oil.
Their consumption of fat and, as a result, the total number of heart attacks is falling.
Hundreds of thousands of people have adopted a vegetarian diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol.
If the heart machine stops, the oxygen is cut off and the person will die unless a special artificial device is used to stimulate the heart.
Each side of the heart performs a different pumping job.
Blood entering the right side of the heart contains carbon dioxide, a waste product.
All blood entering the right side of the heart goes to the lungs before it reaches the left side of the heart.
In the lungs the carbon dioxide is removed and oxygen is added to the blood.
Blood that flows from the left side of the heart contains fresh oxygen.
The oxygen is used in the body cells to produce energy.
Without oxygen the body cells stop working.
An adult heart normally beats about 70 times a minute, but the rate changes automatically to provide as much or as little oxygen as the body needs.
The body needs a log of fuel for strenuous exercise as swimming or ice skating.
For this reason, the heart beats rapidly when a person swims or skates.
It is rushing more oxygen to the body by speeding the flow of blood.
If the person stops exercising, the heart gradually slows down.
The heart beats faster when a person is angry, afraid or excited.
It is rushing more oxygen to the muscles to prepare a person for fighting or for running away.
Atherosclerosis is a condition when deposits of fatty material and calcium narrow the arteries and roughen their normally smooth lining.
Substances from the ruptured cells irritate the nearby tissues causing scars and the artery wall becomes hard, rough and narrow.
The coronary arteries which nourish the heart muscle itself are more frequently affected by this ailment than the others.
Hardening reduces the heart's blood supply and may cause a pain (angina pectoris).
The rough surface of the wall together with the sluggish flow of blood through the narrow channels may cause a clot to form, a thrombus.
A thrombus or embolus may block the artery altogether.
A blocked artery in the brain causes a stroke.
Blockage in a coronary artery causes heart attack.
Hypertension is caused by an increased resistance to the flow of the blood.
Rheumatic Fever is a disease of the young, but not always and is caused by bacteria that cause blood poisoning and scarlet fever.
Congenital heart disease is an ailment present at birth.
A blue baby has a congenital heart disorder.
Bacterial endocarditic can be prevented by giving patients prone to infection adequate doses of antibiotics, before and after operation.
Fibrillation is a condition in which the muscle fibres of the heart work without coordination with an irregular rhythm.
There is still a long way to go in using genetic engineering and making it available to the common man.
A heart attack is always sudden, it comes when we least expect it.
It may come suddenly when we are actively engaged in work or in the peak of achievement and prosperity and in fact even while enjoying good health in our forties.
Then all of a sudden everything turns dark, there is grief and everlasting silence.
Many leave behind young growing children who are studying, a wife with many more years ahead of her, or may be a shattered business.
Except for a few congenital heart diseases the overwhelming majority of heart diseases are not inherited or imposed on us by an unkind nature.
It has become the most common and devastating disease of the modern times, fostered by affluence and bred by tension.
Leading cardiologist Dr. B.K.Goyal disclosed in a seminar in Mumbai that the incidence of heart diseases was increasing and that in India, that day the figure of heart patients stood at 3.5 million.
On the other hand the incidence of such diseases has been going down in the United States in the last 10 years because it was being tackled from many fronts.
In the western world which has suffered the ravages of heart related ailments, there is a growing awareness regarding the food to eat and the life style they should adapt.
An undernourished person may live in unhygienic conditions and succumb to tuberculosis.
A rich, well-fed, tensed up person living in clean surroundings may succumb to a bad heart.
Diseases of the heart are increasing every year because the life style and the pace of modern living is getting faster.
That is if we can understand the factors which have-been contributing to heart disease and modify our way of living.
The coronary disease is not a new disease.
A powerful Roman senator while delivering before the Senate a forceful speech collapsed and expired before he could leave the Hall.
This was attributed to the failure of his heart, a coronary malfunction.
As we grow and the years pass by there are a few changes in the internal lining and walls of the arteries.
The blood vessels which carry blood from the heart suffer from degeneration in the internal lining of the blood vessels and as time goes on gradually it narrows the passage apparently, though initially, it has no bad effect on the body.
In the beginning a fruit juice diet is good.
Fruit juice is a source of fructose and potassium and will help in the recovery of the heart.
A small quantity of honey in water with little fresh lime will be useful.
Raisins soaked for 12 hours and then crushed in water and filtered are recommended.
Plain water must be given from time to time.
Give juices or water in small quantities and frequently.
The patient is asked not to strain himself during defecation.
For the first 3-4 days the patient is given a bedpan, later he can safely use a bedside commode.
Fruits, soups, boiled vegetables and whole wheat chapatti are recommended.
Vegetables should be boiled with no salt.
A little curd can be taken along with lunch and dinner.
If you stick to this regimen recovery will be fast, and you can work out the future course without any more heart attacks, with normal physical activity and enjoy a long life with the help of exercise, diet, relaxation but avoiding all risk factors like smoking, drinking, high calorie food and tension.
Exercise is recommended, it should neither be too little nor too much.
The maximum heart capacity is measured by the cardiologist and you must exercise under expert supervision.
Start with short slow walks of 15 minutes and gradually increase them to 45 minutes.
You can make your walks brisker as the heart gains strength.
In a year's time you may be jogging or doing strenuous exercise like any normal person of your age and capable of taking the strain which you were incapable to take before.
Exercise will increase the circulation of blood to the heart.
It will relax you and will bring down the cholesterol level.
Take a low calorie, low fat, and high fibre food.
Take fruits, cow's milk or low fat milk for breakfast.
Avoid sugar, Sugar is as bad as oil and ghee, being a high calorie food without fibre, it increases cholesterol.
You may have all types of fruits.
The citrus fruits and apples are good.
Take different fruits on different days.
I suggest oranges, sweet limes, apples, pineapples, rose apples, papayas, water berries, raspberries, custard apple.
Any fruit is good enough.
Prefer a fruit instead of juice.
They are a rich source of fibres and vitamins.
Take boiled vegetables, salads and dry whole wheat chapatti and a little curd or pulses if you want to.
Prefer green vegetables, leafy vegetables like parwal, white pumpkin, tinda, tori, cabbage, spinach, tomato, French beans, cauliflower, ladies' fingers, potatoes etc.
For salad add lettuce, cabbage, cucumber, carrots, tomato, beetroots, onions etc.
Do not take too much salad, if it causes flatulence.
Eat sweet fruits like grapes, or an apple after lunch or dinner instead of a sweet dessert.
A glass of juice or coconut water or vegetable juice in the afternoon is recommended.
In the evenings take vegetable soup, boiled vegetable, two whole wheat chapatti and fruits.
Avoid items which are difficult to digest like fried food, meat, sweet, chocolates, ice cream, cold drinks, alcohol, and condiments.
Food should be easily digestible.
In between whenever you feel like eating something eats a fruit or drink a glass of juice.
Drink water in small quantities and more frequently rather than in large quantities at a time.
Take at least 1 or 2 litres of water a day.
A glass of warm water with fresh lime and a spoon of honey (pure) first thing in the morning is a good thing.
It will help you to evacuate easily.
Avoid taking water along with food.
Better to take it 1/2 an hour before or one hour after lunch.
It dilutes the digestive juices and hinders proper digestion.
It will help you to get good sleep.
Low calorie food will bring down cholesterol and reduce strain on the heart.
Do not smoke or chew tobacco.
Nicotine increases heart beat and is bad for the heart.
Take sun bath in the early hours preferably before 8 am.
Sun bathing is pleasant for about an hour a day.
Water treatment could also be of significant help.
Do not take water treatment which is too hot, like sauna or steam bath.
Initially, body sponging twice a day will be good.
Later on take a cold pack on the legs.
It helps to relax and induces sleep.
Take it for 45 minutes in the afternoon or before going to bed.
It could be alternated with an abdominal pack when you are mobile.
Have a total wash before going to bed.
This will relax and induce good sleep.
Foot bath with increasing temperature will help relieve chest pain.
Take arm baths at changing temperatures.
It invigorates the heart and respiration.
Avoid worries, share responsibilities.
Do not get into arguments or get excited.
Keep the atmosphere around cheerful.
Do savasana twice a day 15 minutes each time.
Learn other techniques to relax and use them more often.
Meditation is useful for a heart patient.
Pranayama is also useful.
A heart attack is caused by your lifestyle, change it and avoid another heart attack forever.
The gallbladder is a pear-shaped sac about the size of a golf ball that lies beneath the right side of the liver.
Its main purpose is to collect and concentrate bile, which is a natural agent for digesting fats in the food we eat.
Bile is a clear golden yellow liquid produced in the liver and stored temporarily in the gallbladder.
After we have eaten food that contains fats, the gallbladder releases bile, which travels through ducts (known as the cystic and the common bile ducts) to the small intestines where digestion of fatty food takes place.
There are many possible factors that lead to people developing gallbladder problems.
It is believed to be related either to how our bodies process cholesterol in food or due to gallbladder infection.
Gallbladder problems are usually caused by the presence of gallstones.
Gallstones form when the bile and other liquid chemicals inside the gallbladder go out of balance.
The result is the chemical mixture turning into solid form or sediments.
Over time, some of these sediments begin to grow larger in size and become what is known as gallstones.
If the gallstone is large and travels into the cystic duct, it may block the flow of bile out of the gallbladder.
With its outlet blocked, the gallbladder begins to swell.
When the gallbladder becomes over filled with bile, back flow of bile may occur.
As a result, the gallbladder may become infected.
Symptoms include sharp right sided or central abdominal pain, usually after meals, especially after oily food such as deep fried food, curry etc.
The pain may radiate to the back or shoulder tip.
Nausea, vomiting, fever or jaundice may accompany this.
Your doctor may use ultrasound scan to confirm if you have a gallbladder problem.
After learning your medical history, your doctor may examine you to find out about signs, health problems, and risk factors that point to gallbladder disease.
Diagnostic investigations such as blood tests, ultrasound and CT scan may be used to confirm the problem.
If all goes smoothly, you may go home 2-3 days after the operation.
It may be necessary to postpone the operation.
You are advised not to bring excessive money or valuables when you come in for operation.
If you need help at home when you leave the hospital, please inform your nurse.
One of the hospital social workers will speak to you and your family.
After you arrive in the ward, the nurse will help you settle in and will check your weight and temperature, pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure.
Your doctor will ask you for your medical history and examine you.
He or she will explain to you the nature of your operation as well as its complications.
The doctor will also obtain your consent for operation.
Your anaesthetist will come and assess your fitness for surgery.
Blood may be taken from you for tests to ensure that you are in good health and fit for surgery (if the tests are not already done in the clinic).
Handover any valuables to your nurse for safekeeping before the operation.
You will be asked to change into a specially designed gown before going to the operating theatre.
A nurse will accompany you to the operating theatre.
After the operation, you will be closely monitored in the ward.
You may vomit after the operation due to the side effects of the anaesthesia or feel some pain at the operation site.
If you experience this, inform your nurse.
She may give you an injection to make you feel more comfortable.
This will help to reduce the pain.
If you are feeling well, you are encouraged to sit up or walk slowly around your bed.
After your surgery, you will be given drink or food.
Your nurse will inform you on what to eat or drink.
It is important to eat or drink only as much as you can tolerate.
Your doctor will come and examine you in the morning.
You may go home if he finds you fit.
Walking is important for a quick recovery.
You are encouraged to sit out of bed and walk short distances.
You are advised not to carry heavy things or do strenuous tasks as these may overstrain the muscles around the operation site.
However you are encouraged to continue to exercise moderately.
If you are feeling well, you may be able to take low fat food.
Your nurse will teach you how to care for your wound and to look out for signs of wound infection such as redness and swelling.
If you require more information, an educational pamphlet is available.
Please continue to exercise moderately at home for the next 2 weeks before resuming usual exercise routine.
A low fat diet is recommended for about 3 months.
If you have any questions about how to care for your wound, please ask your nurse.
Please keep your wound clean and dry.
If there is redness or swelling around the wound, please see your GP or polyclinic doctor as soon as possible.
If you need to have your sutures removed, your nurse will inform you of the date to do so.
If you wish to have it done at the polyclinic or GP, please bring along your discharge letter.
When you are ready to go home, your doctor will prescribe medications that you will need.
Your pharmacist or nurse will instruct you on how to take the medications.
If there are any queries, please ask your doctor or nurse.
Before you leave the hospital, your nurse will give you a discharge letter, medical certificate and an appointment date to see the doctor.
However, the medications have to be taken for 18 months ($300/month), and gallstones tend to recur.
This treatment is suitable only for pure cholesterol stones.
Therefore, this form of treatment is not recommended.
The traditional way of removing the gallbladder is through a large abdominal incision.
Risks and complications include excessive bleeding or infection.
Traditional gallbladder surgery requires a large incision at the abdomen.
Today, with this technique, the removal can be accomplished through only four tiny openings, each less than one centimetre in diameter.
Here, a laparoscope (a telescope in which a camera is attached) is inserted through a tiny incision to give a magnified view of the gallbladder.
Instruments are then inserted through other tiny incisions.
After the cystic duct and artery (blood supply to the gallbladder) are identified, tied off with clips and cut, the gallbladder is then detached from the liver bed and removed through an opening in the naval.
Following the procedure, the small incisions are closed with a stitch or two.
Within a few months, the incisions are hardly visible.
In laparoscopic surgery, special instruments can be inserted through small incisions.
These harmless clips will be left inside the body.
By operating through four tiny openings instead of the traditional 20 cm - long incision, most patients have significantly less postoperative pain.
They also heal faster and return to normal activities sooner than patients who have undergone the traditional way of operation.
The operation should also leave smaller scars compared to the traditional method.
Although there are many advantages to laparoscopy, this procedure may not be suitable for some patients who have had previous lower abdominal operations or other pre-existing medical conditions.
A thorough medical evaluation by your doctor can determine if laparoscopic gallbladder removal is the appropriate procedure for you.
After your surgery, you may be required to stay in the hospital for a short period.
Follow your doctor's advice and rebuild your strength gradually.
You may be asked to breathe deeply and cough to clear your lungs.
Walking as soon as possible after surgery helps to keeps your blood circulating.
As your digestive system adjusts, you may begin to eat normally.
Inform your doctor immediately if you discover any side effects that are not expected, such as Fever (over 38oC) or chills, and jaundice.
You should cut down the amount of oil or fat, the body will slowly adjust to oily food after some time.
Gallbladder surgery is one of the most successful kinds of surgery.
Most patients go on to live a healthy and normal lifestyle even without their gallbladder.
The aim of this service is to provide our patients with an additional avenue to ask questions about any signs, symptoms, or health related concerns they may have.
The service is provided by our team of experienced nurses, in consultation with our medical specialists and paramedical staff.
This service is not intended to substitute medical advice or consultation and should not be used for diagnostic or treatment purposes.
Anaesthesia is the use of drugs and special techniques to allow a patient to undergo surgery without experiencing any pain.
In Local Anaesthesia or LA, an anaesthetic agent may be applied onto the surface of the skin or membrane or injected under the skin.
LA, being a relatively safe and simple technique, does not need to be administered by an anaesthetist.
Regional Anaesthesia (RA) involves one or more injections to block the nerve transmission of pain signals to certain parts of the body.
As a result, only a selected part of the body is numbed.
The surgery can even be carried out with the patient remaining awake.
The surgical site is always shielded from the patient.
Patients can also be given sedation so that they may sleep through the procedure.
Unlike normal sleep, the patient will not wake up when disturbed or called.
Thus, when under GA, the patient will be unaware of his surroundings and most importantly, the surgery and pain.
An anaesthetist will be with the patient throughout the surgery and provide post-operative pain relief.
There has been a dramatic decrease in the number of complications and deaths associated with Anaesthesia.
One crucial factor is the presence of an anaesthetist to monitor the well being of the patient.
The development of new monitoring equipment and new drugs has also contributed to the improved safety in Anaesthesia.
The likelihood of "not being able to wake up" from Anaesthesia because of an overdose is very low due to the use of sensitive monitors that are able to monitor the amount of anaesthetic delivered and the use of new anaesthetic drugs which wear off faster.
This is unlikely to happen as anaesthetic drugs are only discontinued when the surgery has been completed.
Generally, most patients will be given some painkillers during the surgery.
However, as different patients have different levels of pain threshold, there may be some pain experienced on awakening.
Additional painkillers can be given to make the patient more comfortable.
Although very rare in nature, serious complications may occur.
There should not be any long-term memory loss.
However, there may be short-term memory loss, where the patient is unable to recall the events around the time of surgery.
This is because some of the medications given to allay anxiety and for sedation also have the ability to cause transient short-term memory loss.
To be certain if you need to continue your medications, please check with your surgeon or anaesthetist.
Fasting is essential when a procedure is to be performed under GA or RA. This is because when a patient is under GA, they lose their protective reflexes.
If there are any food contents in the stomach, this may travel backwards up into the mouth and cause the patient to choke.
The food particles can also pass into the lungs and cause a severe chest infection that may be fatal.
It is also necessary for patients undergoing RA to fast to enable the anaesthetist to convert to GA should RA fail to bring about the desired effect.
We feel anxious when we encounter stressful situations such as losing a job, being caught in a traffic jam, or when the examinations are near.
Fear occurs when the threat is more immediate and easily defined, such as looking over a cliff edge or being attacked by a huge snarling dog.
Some degree of anxiety is useful as it improves our performance and helps us deal with the problems at hand.
Anxiety disorders occur when the anxiety becomes so severe and prolonged that they interfere with our ability to cope with day-to-day activities.
Anxiety disorders are the most common of all mental disorders.
Many people misunderstand these disorders and think that individuals should be able to overcome the symptoms by sheer willpower.
Wishing the symptoms away does not work but treatment can help.
Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is chronic exaggerated worry and tension even when nothing seems to provoke it.
People with GAD anticipate disaster, and worry excessively about health, money, family or work.
They have difficulty in relaxing and are unable to shake off their concerns even though they realize that their anxiety is irrational.
Physical symptoms especially trembling, twitching, muscle tension, headaches, irritability, sweating or hot flashes accompany their worries.
They may feel lightheaded or out of breath and may feel nauseated or have to go to the bathroom frequently.
Usually, the impairment associated with GAD is mild and people with this disorder do not feel too restricted in social settings or on the job.
However if severe, GAD can be debilitating, making it difficult to carry out even the most ordinary daily activities.
People with panic disorder have feelings of terror that strike suddenly and repeatedly with no warning.
They cannot predict when an attack will occur and may develop intense anxiety between episodes, worrying when and where the next one will strike.
In between attacks, there is a persistent, lingering worry that another attack could come any minute.
When a panic attack strikes, the heart pounds and the sufferer may feel sweaty, faint, weak or dizzy.
Their hands may tingle or feel numb and they may feel flushed or chilled.
Chest discomfort, smothering sensation, a sense of unreality, fear of impending doom or loss of control may also be present.
The sufferer may genuinely believe that he is having a heart attack or stroke, losing his mind, or on the verge of death.
While most attacks average a couple of minutes, occasionally they can last for up to ten minutes.
In rare cases, they may last an hour or more.
Panic disorder is often accompanied by other conditions such as depression or alcoholism, and may develop into phobias.
Some people's lives become greatly restricted.
They avoid any situation that would make them feel helpless if a panic attack occurs.
When their lives become so restricted by the disorder, which happens in about one-third of people with panic disorders, the condition is called Agoraphobia.
Phobias are not just extreme fear, they are irrational fear.
If the object of the fear is easy to avoid, people with phobias may not feel the need to seek treatment.
A specific phobia is a fear of a particular object or situation.
Many people experience specific intense, irrational fears of certain things or situations.
Social phobia is an intense fear of being humiliated in social situations, specifically of embarrassing themselves in front of other people.
Small mistakes may seem much more exaggerated than they really are.
Blushing itself may seem painfully embarrassing and the sufferer feel as if all eyes are focused on him or the fear may be more specific, such as feeling anxious about giving a speech, talking to a boss or other authority figure, or dating.
Social phobia disrupts normal life, interfering with career or social relationships.
Agoraphobia, which often accompanies panic disorder, is a fear of being in any situation that might provoke a panic attack, or from which escape might be difficult if one occurred.
People with Agoraphobia are afraid to travel far from home or go into confined places.
The line between normal anxiety and anxiety disorder occurs when overwhelming tension occurs even when there is no real danger, or when extreme measures are taken to avoid the source of anxiety.
Stressful life events can trigger an anxiety disorder.
Anxiety usually goes away after the cause is removed, but sometimes the symptoms persist long after stressful conditions cease.
The odds of developing an anxiety disorder are greater if one of your parents or siblings has the condition.
Hence, your genetic constitution and your life experiences determine whether you will suffer an anxiety disorder.
It is often hard to tell the exact cause of anxiety disorders.
The sufferer is usually vulnerable to a combination of stresses such as personal disposition, life changes and special circumstances.
Talking about the problem sometimes, just talking to a trusted friend or relative whose opinion we value may go a long way in reducing distress.
They may have had similar troubles themselves and are able to share their experiences.
Learning a relaxation technique can help you unwind and bring tension and anxiety under control.
Relaxation techniques include breathing exercises, meditation and imagery.
There are several books and audiotapes available, which you can use to teach yourself these techniques.
This is a more intense talking treatment, which helps patients to recognise, understand and come to terms with reasons for anxiety that may not be readily apparent.
Particular cognitive behavioural therapy approaches also help most anxiety disorders, either in conjunction with medication or alone.
The technique involves getting the individuals to face their feared situations while providing them with cognitive strategies for reducing their anxiety.
Treatment may be more than once a week, lasting for several weeks or months.
A variety of medications are available for the treatment of anxiety disorders.
They are often used in conjunction with the methods described above.
Tranquilisers and antidepressants are two of the most commonly used drugs.
The most commonly used tranquilisers are the benzodiazepines.
They are useful not only for daytime anxiety symptoms but also at night to aid sleep.
Although effective, benzodiazepines may cause dependence after prolonged use, resulting in withdrawal symptoms if the drug is stopped or reduced in dosage.
Hence, benzodiazepines should only be used for short-term management of anxiety symptoms, and not for long-term treatment.
Antidepressants are used to treat anxiety as well as depressive symptoms.
Unlike benzodiazepines, they do not cause dependence.
The commonly used antidepressants include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonergic noradrenergic re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
These must be taken regularly for two to four weeks before significant improvement occurs.
Anxiety disorders have a number of complications.
The first complication is reduced functioning.
In the extreme cases, this can lead to complete disability in which the person can no longer go to school or hold a job.
Depression is also a frequent complication, making the situation worse and heightens the risk for suicide.

Depression is also a frequent complication, making the situation worse and heightens the risk for suicide.
Substance abuse is also a frequent complication, particularly attempts at self-medication with sedatives or alcohol, and may require parallel treatment with a substance abuse program, the first step in seeking treatment is to recognise the symptoms described earlier.
Many sufferers continue to endure their symptoms because they are afraid to see a professional about their problems, for fear of being regarded as "mad".
In fact, most people with anxiety or fear rarely have severe mental illness, and their problems can often be reduced or relieved with treatment.
Bipolar mood disorder, also known as manic-depressive psychosis (MDP), is a type of mood disorder characterised by mood swings.
Many people experience normal mood swings from "Monday morning blues" to "mild euphoria".
In bipolar mood disorder, there are swings from extreme depression to great elation or mania and hyperactivity, occasionally at times losing touch with reality.
However, there are also long periods of complete normality.
Manic depressives suffer from an extreme of mood change over a prolonged period and are regarded as being clinically ill during these attacks.
A doctor or psychiatrist will look at whether an attack of mania is accompanied by depression before diagnosing bipolar mood disorder.
Bipolar mood disorder typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood and continues throughout life.
It is often not recognized as an illness and people who have it may suffer needlessly for years or even decades.
Much research is being carried out as to the causes of bipolar mood disorder but there are no definite conclusions yet.
There may be a genetic predisposition to the illness such that other family members may also suffer from this illness.
It could also be triggered by major stress events or hormonal changes such as those occurring after childbirth.
It may also be due to a chemical imbalance affecting that area of the brain responsible for "moods", thus causing changes in feelings and behaviour.
This is a state in which the person shows a high level of energy, excessive moodiness or irritability, and impulsive or reckless behaviour.
Hypomania may feel good to the person who experiences this and the sufferer seldom thinks that anything is wrong and may object quite violently if anyone tries to point this out to him or her.
With experience, it is possible for some people to recognise their condition but often in an extreme state, all understanding is lost.
It is not unusual for someone suffering an attack to break the law perhaps during a flight of fancy, a bout of excessive spending, committing a fraud, or fortunately, very rarely, of committing a physical assault.
A few people sometimes experience a combination of symptoms from both mania and depression.
This can lead to an increased risk of suicide attempt.
After a period of depression or of mania, the sufferer usually returns to a normal state, back to one's usual personality, thinking capabilities and energy levels without any physiological damage.
However, the sufferer may start regretting the damage done to relationships or finances.
There may be a loss of confidence and also embarrassment.
The frequency of attacks varies not only from one individual to another but also within the same individual.
Other people go for years free from the problem and then have a series of random attacks.
If untreated, sufferers will probably recover by themselves in time but often with devastating effects to their lives, their families and considerable unnecessary suffering.
Wherever possible, early admission to hospital either for mania or severe depression does facilitate a quicker recovery.
In addition, Inpatient treatment also helps to protect the patient from the consequences of the illness, such as rash judgments in mania or suicide attempts in severe depression.
Mood swings in many cases (60-80%) can be controlled or reduced by medications such as mood stabilisers.
The most frequently used medication is lithium carbonate.
This requires careful monitoring with regular blood tests to check for effective levels.
Lithium can keep mood swings within socially and individually acceptable levels and can stave off the worst of the attacks.
The treatment can allow the person to lead a normal and useful life.
Unfortunately for a minority of sufferers, this treatment either has little significant effect or for an even smaller minority, has unacceptable side effects.
Some of the side effects of lithium carbonate are frequent urination, thirst, hand tremors and skin rashes.
At times other drugs are also used to treat either the depression or the mania.
Sometimes, more than one drug is required.
These drugs include antidepressants, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines.
For every drug, there is a "side effect".
These drugs are used only to hasten a return to normality and it is seldom that they have to be continuously given.
Another treatment sometimes used in cases of severe depression and occasionally mania is Electro-Convulsive Therapy (ECT).
When administered, the patient is given a muscle relaxant and a short-acting general anaesthetic.
A strictly controlled electric current is passed through the brain from electrodes placed against the head.
There may be a loss of memory for the period of the treatment but there is no evidence of long-term effects on memory.
Generally,ECT can successfully improve severe depression.
The effects of the mood swings put a great strain on marriages and children (or parents), and on employers and friends as well as the individual sufferer.
In a number of cases this leads to isolation, loss of job, or loss of home, making for further strains and increasing the loneliness of the sufferer.
He or she may have to take mood stabilisers, in one form or another, for an appreciable length of time, possibly even for the rest of their lives.
Try to recognise symptoms early, as it is sometimes possible to stop a mood change from becoming more intense either by early drug treatment or by avoiding difficult situations.
A change in sleep pattern is often a useful indicator of early relapse.
Prevent complications by not abusing alcohol and caffeine products (tea, coffee, coke) and maintaining a balanced diet.
As the illness can be stress-related, learn what causes you stress and plan your life to try and avoid unnecessary stress.
First of all, loved ones and relatives should recognize that the strange behaviour, violent or abusive language or prolonged silences, which characterize certain phases of the illness, is not a previously hidden facet of the personality but a symptom of the mood disorder.
Understand that you may have to lock away or hide household poisons or tablets on certain occasions or at other times go out and find the sufferer.
Do not be afraid to get in touch with the police who have generally been found to be helpful.
You may also have to encourage the person to visit the psychiatrist, or ask for urgent help whenever the sufferer is so "high" that he or she is no longer aware that anything is wrong.
Visiting the sufferer at the hospital can also be a real test of your beliefs and understanding.
You may not be well received, being accused of putting them in hospital etc. It helps the sufferer if you remain consistent and firm in attitude.
You may gain further insight and understanding of the illness from the nursing and medical staff.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection.
Dengue fever is a severe, flu-like illness that affects infants, young children and adults, but rarely causes death.
The 2 most severe forms of dengue are Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) and Dengue Shock Syndrome (DSS).
Dengue viruses are transmitted to humans through the bites of the infective female Aedes mosquito.
Mosquitoes generally acquire the virus while feeding on the blood of an infected person.
Once infective, a mosquito is capable of transmitting the virus to susceptible individuals for the rest of its life.
The dengue virus circulates in the blood of the infected humans for 3 - 14 days (average 4 to 6 days).
The person may experience sudden onset of fever accompanied by a variety of non-specific signs and symptoms.
The signs and symptoms of dengue fever vary according to the age of the patient.
Infants and young children may have a fever and rash.
Older children and adults may have either a mild fever or an abrupt onset of high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains and rashes.
During the acute phase of dengue, it is difficult to distinguish DHF/DSS from Dengue fever and other viral illnesses.
The critical stage of DHF/DSS occurs most frequently from 24 hours before to 24 hours after the temperature falls to or below normal.
Symptoms of DHF include fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, joint pains and body aches, nausea and vomiting and skin rashes.
The patient is generally very ill for seven days, followed by intense weakness for many weeks.
A platelet count of less than 100,000/mm3 is usually found between days 3 and 8 of illness.
Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever causes fever, cough, headache, vomiting and abdominal pain.
There may be blood-clotting problems that may lead to internal bleeding and death.
If Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever is not treated, it can lead to Dengue Shock Syndrome.
In patients with severe DHF or DSS, fever and non-specific signs and symptoms of a few days duration are followed by the sudden deterioration of the patient's condition.
The patient may appear lethargic at first, become restless and then rapidly pass into the critical stage of shock.
The critical stage of DHF/DSS occurs most frequently from about 24 hours after the temperature falls to normal or below.
During this time, haemorrhagic manifestations occur and signs of circulatory failure may appear.
Signs of haemorrhage are common and include bleeding under the skin (petechiae and purpura), gum bleeding, bleeding from the nose and gastrointestinal tract and heavy menstrual flow.
They frequently experience acute abdominal pain shortly before the onset of shock.
The Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever lasts from 3 to 14 days.
The average incubation period is 4 - 6 days.
Dengue viruses are not communicable and cannot be passed from one person to another.
Depression is a very common experience.
Everyone feels fed up, miserable or sad sometimes.
Usually the reason is obvious - disappointment, frustration, losing someone or something important.
Such sadness and grief are normal and temporary reactions to life's stresses.
It is not a sign of personal weakness or a condition that can be willed or wished away.
A depressive disorder is a "whole-body" illness.
It can affect the way you think and the way you feel, both physically and emotionally.
Depressive disorders come in different forms.
Major depression is characterized by a combination of symptoms that affect our work, interests and feelings towards family and friends.
It consists of a severe and persistent depressed mood that lasts for at least two weeks and causes significant distress to interfere with daily functioning.
These disabling episodes can occur once, twice or several times in a lifetime.
Dysthymia is a milder form of depression characterised by long-term, chronic depressive symptoms.
The depressed mood persists for a period of two years and is accompanied by changes in energy, appetite or sleep as well as loss of self-esteem and feelings of hopelessness.
These symptoms cause distress and difficulty in functioning but are not as severe as in major depression.
People who suffer from dysthymia are at increased risk for episodes of major depression.
